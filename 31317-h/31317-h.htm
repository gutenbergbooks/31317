<h2>PREFACE</h2>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;The Campaign of the Jungle&rdquo; is a complete
story in itself, but forms the fifth volume of
the &ldquo;Old Glory Series,&rdquo; a line of tales depicting life
and adventure in our army and navy of to-day.</p>
<p>The heroes of these various stories are the three
Russell brothers, Larry, Walter, and Ben. In the
first volume we told of Larry&rsquo;s adventures while
&ldquo;Under Dewey at Manila,&rdquo; in the second and
fourth we followed Ben as &ldquo;A Young Volunteer
in Cuba&rdquo; and during the opening campaign &ldquo;Under
Otis in the Philippines,&rdquo; while in the third tale we
saw what Walter could do &ldquo;Fighting in Cuban
Waters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the present volume the reader is asked to
follow the fortunes of both Larry and Ben in two
important expeditions of that gallant soldier, General
Henry W. Lawton, the first directed against
Santa Cruz on the Laguna de Bay, where the insurgents
were left badly scattered, and the second from
Manila to San Isidro, a winding advance of about
one hundred and fifty miles through the jungle,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_iv' name='page_iv'></a>iv</span>
which took twenty days to complete, and during
which time twenty-two battles were fought and
twenty-eight towns were captured, along with large
quantities of army stores and the like. This latter
expedition was one of the most daring of its kind,
and could not have been pushed to success had not
the man at its head been what he was, a trained
Indian fighter of our own West, and one whose
nerve and courage were almost beyond comprehension.
Small wonder it was that when, later on, General
Lawton was killed on the firing line, General
Otis cabled, &ldquo;Great loss to us and to his country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As in the previous volumes of this series, the
author has endeavored to be as accurate, historically,
as possible, and for this reason has examined
the reports of the officers high in command, as well
as listened to many tales related by the returning
soldiers themselves. It is therefore hoped that if
any errors have crept in they may not be of sufficient
magnitude to hurt the general usefulness of
the work from an historical standpoint. As a story
of adventure, the writer trusts it will find equal
favor with those that have preceded it in the series.</p>

<h3>DISMAYING NEWS</h3>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;How are you feeling to-day, Ben?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fairly good, Larry. If it wasn&rsquo;t for this awfully
hot weather, the wound wouldn&rsquo;t bother me at all.
The doctor says that if I continue to improve as I
have, I can rejoin my company by the middle of
next week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t hurry matters. You did enough
fighting at Caloocan, Malabon, Polo, and here, to
last you for some time. Let the other fellows have
a share of it.&rdquo; And Larry Russell smiled grimly as
he bent over his elder brother and grasped the hand
that was thrust forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am willing the other fellows should have their
share of the fighting, Larry. But you must remember
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span>
that now Captain Larchmore is dead, and Lieutenant
Ross is down with the fever, there is nobody
to command our company but me&mdash;unless, of course,
Sergeant Gilmore takes charge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let Gilmore play captain for a while, while
you take the rest you have so well earned. Why,
you&rsquo;ve been working like a steam-engine ever since
you landed in Luzon. Gilbert Pennington says he
never dreamed there was so much fight in you, and
predicts that you&rsquo;ll come out a brigadier general by
the time Aguinaldo and his army are defeated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I believe in pushing things,&rdquo; responded
Ben Russell, smiling more broadly than ever, as his
mind wandered back to that fierce attack on Malolos,
where he had received the bullet wound in the side.
&ldquo;If we can only keep the insurgents on the run,
we&rsquo;ll soon make them throw down their arms. But
tell me about yourself, Larry. What have you been
doing since you were up here last?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve been putting in most of my time on
board the <i>Olympia</i>, as usual,&rdquo; replied the young tar.
&ldquo;About all we are doing is to nose around any
strange vessels that come into the harbor. Since
the outbreak in Manila last February, the navy has
had next to nothing to do, and I&rsquo;m thinking strongly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span>
of asking to be transferred to the marines at Cavite,
or elsewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t blame you.&rdquo; Ben Russell paused. &ldquo;Have
you heard anything more about Braxton Bogg and
that hundred and forty thousand dollars he said
he had left hidden in Benedicto Lupez&rsquo;s house in
Manila?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A shade of anxiety crossed Larry Russell&rsquo;s face.
&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve heard a good deal&mdash;more than I wanted
to, Ben. But I wasn&rsquo;t going to speak of it, for
fear of adding to your worry and making you feel
worse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Larry, you don&rsquo;t mean&mdash; Has Braxton
Bogg escaped from jail and got hold of the money
again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Braxton Bogg is still in prison at Manila,
although the Buffalo bank officials are about to
have him returned to the United States for trial.
But the money has disappeared. The police authorities
at Manila went to Benedicto Lupez&rsquo;s house,
to find it locked up and deserted. They broke
in and made a search, but they couldn&rsquo;t find a
dollar, either in Spanish or American money, although
they did find Braxton Bogg&rsquo;s valise and
a dozen or more printed bands of the Hearthstone
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
Saving Institution&mdash;the kind of bands they put
around five-hundred-dollar and one-thousand-dollar
packages of bills.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then this Spaniard found where Bogg had hidden
the money and made off with it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is the supposition; and I reckon it&rsquo;s
about right, too. Of course, it may be possible
that Braxton Bogg never left the stolen money in
Lupez&rsquo;s house, although he swears he did. He
says Lupez was an old friend of his and was going
to have the bills changed into Spanish money for
him, so that Bogg could use the cash without being
suspected of any wrong-doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too bad; and just as we thought our fifteen
or sixteen thousand dollars of the amount was
safe. I wonder what the bank people at home
will say now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, they won&rsquo;t like it. They would
rather have the money than their missing cashier;
and I would rather have the money, too&mdash;not but
that Braxton Bogg ought to be punished for his
crimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Larry, Braxton Bogg deserves all the law
can give him, for the depositors in the Hearthstone
Saving Institution were mostly poor, hard-working
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
persons, and the wrecking of the bank meant untold
hardships for them.&rdquo; The wounded brother
sighed deeply. &ldquo;If that money isn&rsquo;t recovered,
we&rsquo;ll be as badly off as we were when we first
came to Manila,&rdquo; he concluded.</p>
<p>Ben Russell was the eldest of three brothers,
Walter coming next, and Larry being the youngest.
They were orphans, and at the death of their
widowed mother had been left in the care of their
uncle, Job Dowling, a miserly man whose chief aim
in life had been to hoard money, no matter at
what cost, so long as his method was within the
limit of the law.</p>
<p>The boys were all sturdy and had been used to
a good home, and Job Cowling&rsquo;s harsh and dictatorial
manner cut them to the quick. A clash
between guardian and wards had resulted in the
running away of the three youths, and the guardian
had tried in vain to bring them back. Larry had
drifted to San Francisco and shipped on a merchantman
bound for China. He had become a
castaway and been picked up by the Asiatic Squadron
of the United States Navy. This was just at
the time of the outbreak of the war with Spain,
and how gallantly the young tar served his country
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
has already been told in detail in &ldquo;Under
Dewey at Manila.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ben had found his way to New York, and Walter
had drifted to Boston. After several adventures,
the war fever had caught both, and Ben had joined
the army to become &ldquo;A Young Volunteer in Cuba,&rdquo;
as already related in the volume of that name,
while Walter had joined the armored cruiser <i>Brooklyn</i>
and participated in the destruction of the Spanish
fleet in Santiago Bay, as told in &ldquo;Fighting in Cuban
Waters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the three boys were away from home, Job
Dowling had overreached himself by trying to sell
some of the Russell heirlooms which it had been
willed the lads should keep. The heirlooms had
been stolen by a sharper, and it had cost the old man
a neat sum of money to get them back. The experience
made him both a sadder and a wiser man, and
from that time on his manner changed, and when
the boys returned from the war they found that he
had turned over a new leaf. In the future he was
perfectly willing that they should &ldquo;do fer themselves,&rdquo;
as he expressed it.</p>
<p>After a brief stay in Buffalo, Walter had left, to
rejoin the <i>Brooklyn</i>, which was bound for a cruise
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
to Jamaica and elsewhere. At this time trouble
began to break out between the United States troops
in the Philippines and the insurgents who had been
fighting the now-conquered Spaniards, and it looked
as if another fair-sized war was at hand. This being
so, Ben lost no time in re&euml;nlisting in the army,
while Larry hastened to join Admiral Dewey&rsquo;s flagship
<i>Olympia</i> once more. &ldquo;If there&rsquo;s to be any more
fighting, I want to be right in it,&rdquo; was what the
young tar said, and Ben agreed with him. How they
journeyed to Manila by way of the Mediterranean,
the Suez Canal, and the Indian Ocean, has already
been related in &ldquo;Under Otis in the Philippines.&rdquo;
Ben was at this time second lieutenant of Company
D of his regiment. With the two boys went Gilbert
Pennington, Ben&rsquo;s old friend of the Rough Riders,
who was now first sergeant of Company B of the
same regiment, and half a dozen others who had
fought with the young volunteer in Cuba. On
arriving at Manila Larry found matters, so far as it
concerned his ship, very quiet, but Ben was at once
sent to the front, and participated with much honor
to himself in the campaign which led to the fall of
Malolos, a city that was at that time the rebel capital.
As Company D, with Ben at its head as acting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
captain, had rushed down the main street of the
place, an insurgent sharpshooter had hit the young
commander in the side, and he had fallen, to be
picked up later and placed in the temporary
hospital which was opened up in Malolos as soon
as it was made certain that the rebels had been
thoroughly cleaned out. Fortunately for the young
volunteer the wound, though painful, was not
serious.</p>
<p>Of the fifteen thousand to twenty thousand dollars
coming to the Russell brothers, more than three-quarters
had been invested by Job Dowling in the
Heathstone Saving Institution, a Buffalo bank that
had promised the close-minded man a large rate of
interest. The cashier of this bank, Braxton Bogg,
had absconded, taking with him all the available
cash which the institution possessed. Bogg had come
to Manila, and there Ben had fallen in with him
several times and finally accomplished his arrest. It
was found that Braxton Bogg had very little money
on his person, and the guilty cashier finally admitted
that he had left his booty at the house of one Benedicto
Lupez, a Spaniard with whom he had boarded.
As all the Spaniards in Manila were being closely
watched by the soldiers doing police duty in the disturbed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
city, both Ben and Larry had supposed that
there would be no further trouble in getting possession
of the missing money. But Benedicto Lupez
had slipped away unperceived, taking the stolen
money with him, and the Russell inheritance&mdash;or at
least the larger portion of it&mdash;was as far out of the
reach of the boys as ever.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>SOMETHING ABOUT THE SITUATION AT MALOLOS</h3>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know if the Manila authorities have any
idea where this Benedicto Lupez has gone to?&rdquo;
asked Ben, after partaking of some delicacies which
Larry had managed to obtain for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They think he got on a small boat and went up
the Pasig River. He is supposed to have a brother
living in Santa Cruz on the Laguna de Bay. This
brother is said to be in thorough sympathy with the
insurgents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case he is out of our reach for the present,
as the rebels, so I understand, have a pretty
good force in and around Santa Cruz. But if this
Lupez has the money, I can&rsquo;t understand how he
would join the rebels. They&rsquo;ll try to get the cash
from him, if they need it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he is foolish enough to think that they
will win out in this fight, Ben. You know how hot-headed
some of these people are. They haven&rsquo;t any
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
idea of the real power of Uncle Sam. I believe if
they did know, they would submit without another
encounter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be best if they did, Larry, for now that
we are in this fight we are bound to make them
yield. Once they throw down their arms, I feel certain
our country will do what is fair and honest by
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the leaders who are urging the ignorant
common people on&mdash;I&rsquo;ve heard more than one of
the officers say so. The leaders are well educated
and crafty, and they can make the masses believe
almost anything. Why, just before I came away
from Manila I saw a dozen or more Igorottes
brought in&mdash;tall, strapping fellows, but as ignorant
as so many children. They seemed to be dazed
when their wounds were cared for and they were
offered food. The interpreter said they thought
they would be massacred on the spot by the bloodthirsty
<i>Americanos</i>, and they had a lurking suspicion
that they were being cared for just so they could be
sold into slavery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this juncture a tall, thoroughly browned soldier
came in, wearing the uniform of a first lieutenant.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Ben, how is it to-day,&rdquo; he said cheerily,
as he extended his hand. &ldquo;And how are you,
Larry?&rdquo; And he likewise shook hands with the
young tar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m hoping to get out soon, Gilbert,&rdquo; answered
Ben. &ldquo;But what&rsquo;s this&mdash;a lieutenant&rsquo;s uniform?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve been promoted to first lieutenant of
Company B,&rdquo; returned Gilbert Pennington. &ldquo;I tell
you, we are all climbing up the ladder, and Larry
must look to his laurels. I understand you are to
be made permanent captain of Company D.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where is First Lieutenant Crunger of your
company?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Disappeared,&rdquo; and the young Southerner&rsquo;s face
took on a sober look. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the only thing that
mars my happiness over my promotion. After the
taking of Malolos, Jack Crunger disappeared utterly,
and we haven&rsquo;t been able to find hide nor hair of
him, although half a dozen scouting parties have
been sent out and the stream has been dragged in
several places.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he was taken prisoner,&rdquo; suggested
Larry. &ldquo;I heard some of the Kansas and Utah men
were missing, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are afraid he is a prisoner, and if that is so,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
Aguinaldo&rsquo;s men have probably taken him up to San
Fernando, where the insurgents are setting up their
new capital.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what is going on at the firing line?&rdquo; asked
Ben, eagerly. &ldquo;Are they following up the rebels&rsquo;
retreat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to say no. General MacArthur made
a <a name='TC_1'></a><ins class='trchange' title="Was 'reconnoissance'">reconnaissance</ins> in the direction of Calumpit, but it
amounted to little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand that the <i>Charleston</i> has sailed up
the coast and is going to shell Dagupan,&rdquo; put in
Larry. &ldquo;Dagupan, you know, is the terminus of
the railroad line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good,&rdquo; came from the sick brother. &ldquo;If
we can get a footing in Dagupan, we can work the
railroad territory from both ends.&rdquo; But this was
not to be, as coming events speedily proved, for the
shelling of the city by the warship amounted to but
little.</p>
<p>Gilbert Pennington knew all about the Braxton
Bogg affair and listened with interest to what Larry
had to relate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too bad,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to give
you some hope, boys, but I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ll have to
whistle for your fortune. That Spaniard will keep
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
out of the reach of the Americans, and if the worst
comes to the worst, he&rsquo;ll slip off to Spain or South
America; you mark my words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Larry&rsquo;s leave of absence was for forty-eight hours
only, and soon he was forced to bid his brother and
his friend good-by. &ldquo;Now take good care of yourself,
Ben,&rdquo; he said, on parting. &ldquo;And do stay here
until you are stronger. Remember that a wounded
man can&rsquo;t stand this broiling sun half as well as one
who isn&rsquo;t wounded, and even the strongest of them
are suffering awfully from the heat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make him stay,&rdquo; put in Gilbert, with mock
severity. &ldquo;Surgeon Fallox won&rsquo;t give him clearance
papers until I tell him, for he&rsquo;s a great friend
of mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to have a word with Stummer before
I go,&rdquo; added Larry, and hurried to the ward in
which the sturdy German volunteer had been placed.
He found the member of Ben&rsquo;s company propped up
on some grass pillows, smoking his favorite brier-root
pipe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, an&rsquo; I vos glad to see you, Larry,&rdquo; cried
Carl, his round face broadening into a smile on
beholding his visitor. &ldquo;Yah, I vos doin&rsquo; putty
goot, und I peen out on der firin&rsquo; line next veek
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
maype. But say, I vos sorry I peen shot town
pefore we got to Malolos. I vos dink sure I help
clean dose repels out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, you did your duty, Carl. I&rsquo;ve
heard they are going to make you a corporal for
your bravery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, an&rsquo; that&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; came in an Irish voice
behind the pair, and Dan Casey, another volunteer
of Ben&rsquo;s company, appeared. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s mesilf as has the
honor av saying it first, too, Carl. You are to be
first corporal, Carl, wid meself doin&rsquo; juty as second
corporal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The German volunteer&rsquo;s face lit up for a second,
then fell suspiciously. &ldquo;Say, Dan, vos dis a choke
maype?&rdquo; he said slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A joke, is it?&rdquo; burst out Casey. &ldquo;Sure, an&rsquo; do
ye think I&rsquo;d be afther playin&rsquo; a joke on a wounded
man, Carl? No, it&rsquo;s no joke. We&rsquo;re raised to the
dignity av officers be the forchunes av war an&rsquo; the
recommendations av our superior, Actin&rsquo; Captain
Russell, which same will soon be our captain be
commission, Providence an&rsquo; the President willin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good for Ben!&rdquo; exclaimed Larry. &ldquo;You both
deserve it.&rdquo; And after a few words more he hurried
off, leaving the two old soldiers to congratulate
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
themselves on their advancement and speculate
upon how high they might rise in the service
before the rebellion should close. Casey had his
eye set on a captaincy, but Stummer said he would
be quite content if any commissioned office came
his way, even if it was but a second-lieutenancy.</p>
<p>Malolos had been captured on Friday, March 31,
1899, at a little after ten o&rsquo;clock in the morning,
although the fighting kept up until nearly nightfall.
As soon as the rebels were thoroughly cleaned
out, many of the soldiers were called upon to do
duty as firemen, for a large portion of the town
was in flames. While the fire was being put out,
other soldiers went about stopping the Chinese
from looting the deserted mansions. The coolies
were at first made prisoners and put under guard
in the public park, but later on they were released
and set to work to clean the streets.</p>
<p>As Gilbert had said, the days immediately following
the fall of Malolos were not of special activity.
The hard, running fight along the railroad through
Caloocan, Polo, and other places, had all but exhausted
the army under General MacArthur, and
when the insurgents&rsquo; capital was taken, it was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
felt that the soldiers had earned a well-needed
rest. Moreover, many had been wounded and many
more were down, suffering from the heat and tropical
fever, and these had to be cared for in the
temporary hospitals established at various points
in the neighborhood. In the meantime the railroad
was repaired and Malolos was made a new
base for supplies. There were several skirmishes
in the neighborhood north and northeast of Malolos,
and in these the rebels were compelled to fall
back still further, yet the outbreaks amounted to
but little.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the Philippine Commission of
the United States issued a proclamation, translated
into the Spanish and Tagalog languages, calling
upon the insurgents to throw down their arms and
promising them good local government, the immediate
opening of schools and courts of law, the
building of railroads, and a civil service administration
in which the native should participate.
This proclamation was widely distributed, yet it
did little good; for the common people of the
islands were given to understand by their leaders
that the Americans did not mean what they said,
but had come to their country only to plunder
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
them, and would in the end treat them even worse
than had the Spaniards.</p>
<p>It was no easy work to repair the railroad running
from Manila to Malolos Station, which was
some distance from the town proper. All tools
and equipments had to be brought up from Manila
and from Cavite, and soon the engineering corps
found themselves harassed by some rebels in the
vicinity of Marilao and Guiguinto. At once General
MacArthur sent out a force to clear the ground,
and several sharp attacks ensued, which resulted
in the loss of twenty-three killed and wounded on
the American side, and double that number to the
enemy. In the end the rebels fled to the mountains
to the eastward and to Calumpit on the
north.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are going out to-morrow,&rdquo; said Gilbert,
as he came to see Ben on the day following the
engagements just mentioned. &ldquo;General Wheaton
says he is going to drive the rebels straight into
the mountains&mdash;and I reckon he&rsquo;ll keep his word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ben was at once anxious to go along, but this
was not yet to be, and he was forced to sit at a
window of the hospital and see his regiment march
by with colors flying gayly and all &ldquo;the boys&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
eager for another contest. The members of his
own company gave him a cheer as they passed.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll soon be with us again, captain,&rdquo; cried one.
&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t forget you! Hurrah!&rdquo; and on they
marched, with a lieutenant from Company A leading
them, and with Gilbert and Major Morris and
many old friends with the regiment. Ben watched
them out of sight, and heaved a long sigh over
the fact that he was not of their number. But
there was still plenty of fighting in store for the
young captain, and many thrilling and bitter experiences
in the bargain.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>AN ADVENTURE ON THE PASIG RIVER</h3>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah, Luke! I reckon I am going to see
a bit of fighting at last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Larry who spoke, as he rushed up to his
old friend, Luke Striker, now one of the gun captains
on board the <i>Olympia</i>. It was the day after
the young tar had paid the visit to Ben.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fighting? where?&rdquo; demanded the Yankee gunner.
&ldquo;Do you mean to say as how the <i>Olympia</i>
is goin&rsquo; to do some scoutin&rsquo; alongshore, lad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, the ship is going to remain right where
she is. But General Lawton is going to take an
expedition up the Pasig River from San Pedro
Macati to the Laguna de Bay, and some of the
sailors are going along to help manage the cascos
and other boats. I just applied for a place, along
with Jack Biddle, and we both got in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why can&rsquo;t I get in?&rdquo; returned Luke,
eagerly. &ldquo;This here everlastin&rsquo; sitting still, doin&rsquo;
nuthin&rsquo;, is jest a-killin&rsquo; of me.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You might apply, although there are already
more volunteers than they want,&rdquo; answered Larry.
He told his old friend how to make the necessary
application, and soon Luke had joined the expedition;
and the three friends hastened ashore and on
board a shallow river transport, which was to take
them and a number of others up to San Pedro
Macati.</p>
<p>The brief journey to the latter-named village was
without incident. Here Larry found assembled a
body of about thirteen hundred soldiers, infantry
and cavalry, and with them two hundred picked
sharpshooters, and two guns manned by members
of the regular artillery. Owing to the sickness
of the commanding general, General Lawton took
personal charge of the expedition.</p>
<p>No man was better fitted for fighting in the
Philippines than Major General Henry W. Lawton,
who had but lately arrived in the islands, and who
was destined to die the death of a hero upon the
firing line. Of commanding appearance, being six
feet three inches in height and weighing over two
hundred pounds, he was a soldier by nature and a
natural leader among leaders. He had fought all
through the great Civil War with much credit to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
himself, and it was he who, during the great
Apache Indian uprising, followed the crafty Geronimo
through mountain and over desert for a distance
of nearly fourteen hundred miles, and at last
caused him to surrender. For this, it is said, the
Indians called him &ldquo;Man-who-gets-up-in-the-night-to-fight,&rdquo;
and they respected him as they respected
few others.</p>
<p>With the outbreak of the war with Spain General
Lawton was in his element, and when the army
of occupation sailed for Santiago he was with them;
and it was this same Lawton who stormed El Caney
and captured it, as related in &ldquo;A Young Volunteer
in Cuba.&rdquo; When General Shafter wanted to call
Lawton away from El Caney, after the troops had
been fighting many hours, Lawton sent him word,
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stop&mdash;I&rsquo;ve got to fight,&rdquo; and went forward
again; and in less than an hour the Spanish
flag at the top of the hill was down, and Old Glory
had taken its place.</p>
<p>General Lawton was addressing several members
of his staff when Larry first saw him at San Pedro
Macati. He stood, war map in hand, in front of
the river landing, a conspicuous figure among the
half-dozen that surrounded him.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a fighter&mdash;you can see that,&rdquo; whispered
Larry to Luke, who stood beside him. &ldquo;Just look
at that square-set jaw. He won&rsquo;t let up on the
rebels an inch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jest the kind we&rsquo;re a-wantin&rsquo; out here,&rdquo; responded
the Yankee gunner. &ldquo;The more they
force the fightin&rsquo; the sooner the war will come to
an end. He&rsquo;s coming toward us,&rdquo; he added, as
General Lawton stepped from out of the circle
around him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are from the <i>Olympia</i>, I believe?&rdquo; he said,
addressing Luke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, general,&rdquo; replied the old gunner, touching
his forelock, while Larry also saluted. &ldquo;We volunteered
for this expedition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You look all right, but&mdash;&rdquo; General Lawton
turned to Larry. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you are rather
young for this sort of thing, my lad,&rdquo; he went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope not, sir,&rdquo; cried Larry, quickly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
seen fighting before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was in the thickest of it when we knocked
out Admiral Montojo, general,&rdquo; interposed Luke.
&ldquo;You can trust him to do his full share, come
what may.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, if he was in that fight I guess he&rsquo;ll be all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
right,&rdquo; responded General Lawton, with a grim sort
of a smile. And he turned away to overlook the
shipping of some ammunition on one of the tinclad
gunboats which was to form part of the expedition.</p>
<p>The troops were speedily on the cascos, which
were to be towed by several steam launches and
escorted by three tinclads. Although Larry and
his friends did not know it till several hours
later, the destination was Santa Cruz, a pretty
town, situated on a slight hill overlooking the
placid waters of the Laguna de Bay. The general&rsquo;s
plan was to reach the lake by nightfall, and
steal over the silent waters in the dark until the
vicinity of Santa Cruz was gained, in hopes that
the garrison might be caught &ldquo;napping,&rdquo; as it is
called.</p>
<p>For the time being the sailors were separated
one from another, each being put in charge of a
casco, the shallow rowboats being joined together
in strings of four to six each, and pulled along
with many a jerk and twist by the puffing little
launches, which at times came almost to a standstill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t reach the lake by sunrise, and I
know it,&rdquo; remarked one of the soldiers to Larry,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
who stood in the bow of the casco with an oar,
ready to do whatever seemed best for the craft.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve a good many miles to go yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that instant the casco ahead ran aground in
the shallow river, and Larry had all he could do
to keep his craft from running into it. As the
two boats came stem to stern one of the soldiers
in the craft ahead called out to those behind:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Idaho, do you know where we are bound?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bound for Santa Cruz, so I heard our captain
remark,&rdquo; answered one of the soldiers in Larry&rsquo;s
boat. &ldquo;Got any tobacco, North Dakota?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nary a pipeful, wuss luck,&rdquo; was the response;
and then the line straightened out as the casco
ahead cleared herself from the mud, and the two
boats moved apart once more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are we really going to Santa Cruz?&rdquo; questioned
Larry, as soon as he got the chance. &ldquo;I thought
we were bound for the north shore of the lake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can only tell you what I heard the captain
say,&rdquo; answered the soldier, with a shrug of his
shoulder. &ldquo;General Lawton ain&rsquo;t blowing his plans
through a trumpet, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope we do go to Santa Cruz,&rdquo; mused Larry,
as he thought of what had been said of Benedicto
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
Lupez. &ldquo;And if we take the town I hope we take
that rascal, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The best laid plans are often upset by incidents
trifling in themselves. It was the dry season of
the year, and the Pasig River, usually broad and
turbulent, was now nothing better than a muddy,
shallow creek, winding and treacherous to the last
degree. As night came on the expedition found
itself still in the stream and many miles from the
lake, and here cascos and launches ran aground and
a general mix-up ensued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo, what have we run up against now?&rdquo;
growled the lieutenant in charge of the soldiers
in Larry&rsquo;s boat. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you keep out of the mud,
Jackie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m doing my best,&rdquo; panted the youth, as he
shoved off for at least the fourth time. &ldquo;With the
lines forward and aft pulling one way and another
it&rsquo;s rather difficult to keep to the channel, especially
in the dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re only a boy and don&rsquo;t understand the
trick,&rdquo; growled the lieutenant, who was in a bad
humor generally. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why they let you
come along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our boat is doing about as well as any of them,&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
answered Larry, bound to defend himself. &ldquo;Two
boats are aground to our left and three behind us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here, don&rsquo;t talk back to me! You tend to
business and keep us out of the mud,&rdquo; roared the
lieutenant, in worse humor than before.</p>
<p>An angry retort arose to Larry&rsquo;s lips, but he
checked it. &ldquo;A quarrel won&rsquo;t do any good,&rdquo; he
thought. &ldquo;But what a bulldog that fellow is&mdash;as
bad as Quartermaster Yarrow, who caused me
so much trouble on the trip out here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On went the cascos once more, around a tortuous
bend and past a bank fringed with bushes and
reeds. The mosquitoes were numerous, likewise
the flies, and everybody began to wish the journey
at an end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better make a charge on the insects,&rdquo;
growled one old soldier. &ldquo;They are worse nor the
rebels ten times over,&rdquo; and, just then, many were
inclined to agree with him. Tobacco was scarce or
smoking would have been far more plentiful than
it was.</p>
<p>Midnight came and went, and found the expedition
still some distance from the lake. A few of
the soldiers were sleeping, but the majority remained
wide awake, fighting off the marshland pests, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
aiding in keeping the cascos and launches from running
high and dry in the mud. Had it not been
for the tinclads it is doubtful if the Laguna de Bay
would have been gained at all by more than half
of the craft composing the turnout. But they came
to the rescue time and again, and so the expedition
crawled along, until, at four o&rsquo;clock, the clear sheet
of water beyond was sighted.</p>
<p>They were making the last turn before the lake
was gained when the casco ahead of that steered by
Larry went aground once more, dragging Larry&rsquo;s
craft behind it. The youth did all he could to
back water, but in vain, and once more they heard
the unwelcome slish of mud under their bottom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;ve done it again!&rdquo; howled the lieutenant,
leaping up from his seat. &ldquo;You numskull!
give me that oar.&rdquo; And he tried to wrench the
blade from Larry&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was not my fault,&rdquo; began the youth, when
the officer forced the blade from him and hurled
him back on one of the soldiers. Then the lieutenant
tried to do some poling for himself, and got
the oar stuck so tightly in the mud that he could
not loosen it.</p>
<p>Burning with indignation, Larry felt himself go
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
down in a heap, and at once tried to get up again.
At the same time the soldier beneath him gave him
a shove which pitched him several feet forward.
He landed up against the lieutenant with considerable
force, and in a twinkle the officer went overboard,
head first, into the water and mud where the
casco had stuck fast.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>THE GAP IN THE FIRING LINE</h3>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo, Lieutenant Horitz has fallen overboard!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pull him out of the mud, before he smothers or
drowns!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such were some of the cries which arose among
the soldiers that filled the casco. Then Larry was
shoved back, and two of them caught hold of the
legs of the man who had disappeared, as for an
instant they showed themselves. There was a &ldquo;long
pull, a strong pull, and a pull altogether,&rdquo; and up
came the lieutenant, minus his hat and with his face
and neck well plastered with the black ooze of the
river bottom.</p>
<p>For a moment after he sank on the seat that was
vacated to receive him, he could not speak. One
of the soldiers handed him a handkerchief, and with
this he proceeded to clear his eyes and ears, at the
same time puffing vainly to get back his breath. At
last he cleared his throat and glared angrily at
Larry.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you young whelp!&rdquo; he fumed. &ldquo;You&mdash;you
knocked me over on purpose!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir, I did not,&rdquo; answered the young tar,
promptly. &ldquo;One of the soldiers shoved me up
against you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you,&rdquo; roared the unreasonable
one, as he continued to clean himself off. &ldquo;You
shall pay dearly for this assault, mark me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you shove me?&rdquo; asked Larry, appealing
to one of the soldiers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shoved you off of my neck, yes,&rdquo; answered the
enlisted man. &ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t throw you into Lieutenant
Horitz. You did that yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course he did it himself,&rdquo; said another soldier,
who did not wish to see his tent-mate get into trouble.
&ldquo;You had it in for the lieutenant ever since
he first spoke to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall report you the first chance I get,&rdquo; growled
Lieutenant Horitz. &ldquo;I reckon you&rsquo;ll find that
General Lawton won&rsquo;t allow any such disgraceful
conduct while he is in command.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the row back there?&rdquo; came out of the
darkness. &ldquo;Hurry up and get afloat, or we&rsquo;ll cut
the rope and leave you to shift for yourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our officer was just shoved overboard,&rdquo; answered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
Snapper, the soldier who had given Larry the
unlucky push. &ldquo;And we&rsquo;ve lost our oar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I have the oar,&rdquo; put in Larry, making a
clutch into the water for the article just as it was
about to float out of reach. He leaped into the bow
once more, and began to work vigorously, and in a
few seconds they were again afloat.</p>
<p>Fortunately for the lieutenant the night was warm,
so he suffered no inconvenience so far as his wet
clothing was concerned. But it was no mean task
to clean both himself and his uniform, and what to
do for another hat he did not know. He would have
taken Larry&rsquo;s headgear had that article been anyway
suitable, but it was not.</p>
<p>It must be confessed that Larry felt thoroughly ill
at ease. That there was trouble ahead went without
saying, and he half wished himself safe back on the
<i>Olympia</i>. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll make out the worst case he can
against me,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;And his men will back
him up in all he says.&rdquo; Yet he felt that he was
guilty of no intentional wrong-doing, and resolved
to stand up for himself to the best of his ability.</p>
<p>The lieutenant had learned one lesson&mdash;that he
knew no more about handling the casco than did
Larry, if as much, and, consequently, he offered no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
more suggestions as to how to run the craft. But he
kept muttering under his breath at the youth, and
Larry felt that he was aching to &ldquo;get square.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was early dawn when the casco turned into the
lake proper. As the sun came up it shed its light
on one of the prettiest sheets of water Larry had
ever beheld. The lake was as smooth as a millpond,
and surrounded with long stretches of marshland
and heavy thickets of tropical growth. Fish were
plentiful, as could be seen by gazing into the clear
depths below, and overhead circled innumerable
birds. Villages dotted the lake shore at various
points, but these the expedition gave a wide berth,
setting out directly for Santa Cruz, still several miles
distant, behind the hill previously mentioned.</p>
<p>If it had been General Lawton&rsquo;s intention to
attack the town from in front in the dark, that plan
had now to be changed, and the expedition turned
toward shore at a point at least three miles from the
town proper.</p>
<p>But even here the rebels could be seen to be on the
alert, and a rapid-firing gun was put into action and
directed along the lake front. The gun was manned
by some men from the <i>Napadan</i>, and did such wonderful
execution that soon the insurgent sentries
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
were seen to be fleeing toward the town at utmost
speed. Then a small detachment from some brush
also retreated, and the coast was clear.</p>
<p>It was no easy matter to land, as the water here
was shallow and the cascos had to be poled along
over the soft mud. The sharpshooters were the first
ashore, and they soon cleared a spot for the others.
But a few of the rebels were &ldquo;game,&rdquo; and as a result
one man was wounded, although not seriously. The
cavalry remained on the boats, to land closer to the
hill later on.</p>
<p>The landing had consumed much valuable time,
and it was now after noon. A hasty meal was had,
and then the column moved off, spreading out in fan
shape as it advanced, the sharpshooters to the front
and the rear, and a number of special scouts on
the alert to give the first warning of danger. Soon
the scouts in front came back with the news that the
insurgents were forming in front of our troops and
that Santa Cruz and its garrison seemed thoroughly
aroused to the danger which threatened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forward, boys!&rdquo; was the cry. &ldquo;The more time
we give them, the better they will be prepared to
meet us. Forward without delay!&rdquo; And the
&ldquo;boys&rdquo; went forward with a wild hurrah, for everything
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
promised well, and they were much pleased to
have General Lawton lead them, even though they
had no fault to find with their other commanders.</p>
<p>The first skirmish began on the extreme right.
Some rebels had found their way to a hill behind
the town, and they began the attack from a patch
of wild plantains, thickly interlaced with tropical
vines. Up the hill after them dashed the right
wing, and the sharp rattle of musketry resounded
upon both sides for the best part of half an hour.
Then the rebels broke and ran, and in their eagerness
our troops followed them until a point less
than two miles from Santa Cruz was gained. Here
the insurgents scattered, and could not be rounded
up, and the right wing fell back, to unite with
the main body of the expedition. But the woods
were thick, the ground new to the Americans, and
in the gathering darkness it was several hours before
the firing line was compact once more. Then
the expedition rested for the night.</p>
<p>Larry had landed with the soldiers, and, as the
other cascos came up, he was speedily joined by
Luke Striker and Jack Biddle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder what part we air to take in this
comin&rsquo; mix-up?&rdquo; queried Luke.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Like as not they will leave us here to mind
the boats,&rdquo; replied Larry. &ldquo;I can tell you that
I am rather sorry I came along,&rdquo; he added soberly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry!&rdquo; ejaculated Jack Biddle. &ldquo;Surely,
Larry, ye ain&rsquo;t afraid&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not afraid,&rdquo; interrupted the youth.
And then he told of the scene in the casco, and
of what Lieutenant Horitz had said. When he
had finished, Jack cut a wry face and Luke uttered
a low whistle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve run up agin a rock fer sartin, Larry,&rdquo;
remarked Luke. &ldquo;I reckon he can make things
look putty bad for ye if he&rsquo;s of a mind to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep quiet an&rsquo; say nuthin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; he may forgit
all about it,&rdquo; was Jack Biddle&rsquo;s advice.</p>
<p>The boats having been cared for, the sailors followed
the soldiers through the field and into the
woods. All told there were twenty-five jackies,
and by common consent they formed themselves
into a company of their own, with a petty officer
named Gordell at their head. Gordell went to
General Lawton for directions, and was told to
follow the volunteers until given further orders.
Each sailor was armed with a pistol and a ship&rsquo;s
cutlass.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span></div>
<p>The march was a hot one, but Larry was now
getting accustomed to the tropics and hardly
minded this. The little company advanced with
caution, nobody desiring to run into an ambush.
Soon the firing on the right reached their ears, and
they knew that some sort of an engagement was on.
Then came a halt, and presently the darkness of
night fell over them; and they went into camp beside
a tiny watercourse flowing into a good-sized
stream which separated the expedition from the
outskirts of Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Supper disposed of, Larry and Luke Striker took
a stroll forward, to find out what the firing line
was really doing and if the insurgents were in
front in force. &ldquo;We may have a bigger fight on
hand nor any of us expect,&rdquo; suggested the old
Yankee gunner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can trust General Lawton not to run his
head into the lion&rsquo;s mouth,&rdquo; returned Larry. &ldquo;A
soldier who has whipped the Apache Indians isn&rsquo;t
going to suffer any surprise at the hands of these
Tagals, no matter how wily they are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be too sure o&rsquo; thet, Larry. The best
on us make mistakes sometimes,&rdquo; answered the
Yankee, with a grave shake of his head. But General
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
Lawton made no mistake, as we shall speedily
see.</p>
<p>As has been said, the right wing had become
detached from the main body of the expedition
during the fight on the hill back of Santa Cruz.
The firing line of this wing had not yet united
with the centre, consequently there was a gap of
over a quarter of a mile in the front. Had the
Tagalogs known of this they might have divided
the expedition and surrounded the right wing completely,
but they did not know, so the temporary
separation did no damage to the soldiers. But
that gap brought a good bit of trouble to Larry
and his friend.</p>
<p>On and on went the pair, down a narrow road
lined on either side with palms and plantains and
sweet-smelling shrubs. From the hollows the frogs
croaked dismally, and here and there a night bird
uttered its lonely cry, but otherwise all was silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph, they&rsquo;ve pushed the firing line ahead
further than I thought,&rdquo; remarked Luke, after
half a mile had been covered. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a small river.
Do ye reckon as how they went over thet, lad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be so,&rdquo; answered the boy. &ldquo;Certainly,
we haven&rsquo;t been challenged.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span></div>
<p>Crossing the rude bridge, they found that the
road made a sharp turn to the southward. Beyond
was a nipa hut, back of which burnt a small camp-fire.
Both hut and fire seemed deserted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have cleaned the rebels out from there,&rdquo;
said Larry. &ldquo;Come ahead,&rdquo; and they continued
on their way, little dreaming of the trap into
which they were walking.</p>
<p>The nipa hut passed, they came to a tall fence
built of bamboo stalks, sharpened at the tops and
bound with native rope-vine. Farther on still
were a dozen shelters, and here could be seen several
women and children sitting in the doorways.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps they can give us some information,&rdquo;
said Larry, as they approached the natives. As
soon as they saw the Americans the children
shrieked dismally and rushed out of sight. But
the women held their ground, feeling that they
would not be molested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See anything of our soldiers?&rdquo; demanded Luke
of the women, but one and all shook their heads.
&ldquo;No Englees talk,&rdquo; mumbled one, meaning they
did not understand or speak our tongue.</p>
<p>The natives&rsquo; manner made Larry suspicious, and
he glanced around hurriedly. As he did so there
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
was a click of a trigger from behind the bamboo
fence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Americanos</i> surrender,&rdquo; came in bad English
from back of the fence. &ldquo;Surrender quick, or
we shoot both dead on the spot!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>AN ENCOUNTER AT THE RIVER</h3>
</div>
<p>To say that both Larry and his old friend were
surprised at the sudden demand which had been
made upon them would be to put the truth very
mildly. They had been of the firm belief that the
insurgents had retreated, and to find themselves
in a &ldquo;reg&rsquo;lar hornet&rsquo;s nest,&rdquo; as Luke afterward
expressed it, dumfounded them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you surrender, or not?&rdquo; came the words,
after an awkward pause.</p>
<p>It was dark about the huts, yet not so dim but
that they could see the barrels of several Mauser
rifles thrust toward them. The sight made Larry
shiver, for he had never before met the rebel soldiers
at such close quarters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re in a box,&rdquo; muttered Luke. &ldquo;Somethin&rsquo;
wrong somewhar&mdash;our soldiers didn&rsquo;t come this
way, ye kin reckon on thet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I move we run for it,&rdquo; whispered Larry. &ldquo;If
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
they take us prisoners&mdash;&rdquo; He did not finish, but
his silence was more impressive than mere words
would have been. He had heard many stories of
terrible cruelty practised by the insurgents on
their prisoners, and whether these tales were true
or not, they had had their full effect on both him
and his shipmates.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are ye goin&rsquo; to run to, lad? We don&rsquo;t
want to run an&rsquo; be shot down in cold blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get in front of me and take to the woods
opposite, <a name='TC_2'></a><ins class='trchange' title="Changed single quote mark to double quote mark">Luke,&rdquo;</ins> was the hurried reply. &ldquo;Here
goes! I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;ll fire now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Larry concluded, he sprang to the side of
one of the native women standing nearest to him.
Before the woman could resist, he had her in his
arms behind him and was running off as speedily
as the weight of his living load permitted. Seeing
this, Luke scuttled off before, and away they
went for the woods, not twenty yards distant.</p>
<p>A howl arose on the night air, and one gun
went off, but the bullet did no damage. Then the
leader of the rebels was heard, calling to his men
not to fire, for fear of killing the woman, who
chanced, by good luck, to be a close relative; for
the soldiers behind the bamboo fence were part of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
a home guard brought out that very afternoon to
defend the road and Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>The woman on Larry&rsquo;s back shrieked in terror
and clawed at his neck and hair, causing him
considerable pain. But he held his burden tight
until the shelter of the trees was gained, when he
let her slip to the ground and darted after Luke,
who was running with all the speed of his lanky
limbs.</p>
<p>It was pitch dark in the jungle, and the pair
had not advanced more than a hundred yards
when they found themselves going down into a
hollow which both felt must lead to a dangerous
swamp, or morass, for the island of Luzon is full
of such fever-breeding places.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go slow, lad,&rdquo; whispered Luke, as he caught
Larry by the hand. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to land out
o&rsquo; the fryin&rsquo;-pan into the fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They both became silent and listened attentively.
At a distance they heard the insurgents coming
on slowly and cautiously, spreading out as they
advanced. Probably they knew the topography of
the country and meant to surround the hollow
completely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are coming, that&rsquo;s sure,&rdquo; whispered Larry,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
and clutched his pistol. &ldquo;I wonder if we can&rsquo;t
get away from them by climbing a tree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&mdash;if they ain&rsquo;t a-followin&rsquo; the trail
putty close,&rdquo; answered his companion.</p>
<p>They began to search around for a tree, and in
doing so came to several large rocks, much over-grown
with trailing vines. There was an opening
between two of the rocks, and Luke slipped into
this, hauling Larry after him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jest as good as a tree, an&rsquo; mebbe better,&rdquo; he
whispered, as he rearranged the vines over the
opening.</p>
<p>The hiding-place was not a large one, and Larry
felt very much like a sardine in a box as he
crouched close to his Yankee friend. The vines
covered the opening completely, yet they remained
on guard, each with his finger on the trigger of
his weapon, resolved, if the worst came to the
worst, to fight the best they knew how before
surrendering.</p>
<p>The Filipinos were evidently puzzled, for they
had come to a halt and made not the slightest
noise. Possibly they were listening for some sound
from those they were pursuing, but if so, none
came, for Luke clapped his hand warningly over
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
Larry&rsquo;s mouth, and the youth understood and remained
as motionless as a statue.</p>
<p>Five minutes went by&mdash;to the boy they seemed
an age&mdash;and then the rebels came on again, halting
every few steps to make sure of their ground.
Three passed close to the rocks, so close in fact
that Larry and Luke could have shot them down
without trouble. But this would have given the
alarm to the entire party, and neither the boy nor
the man wanted to shed blood unless it became
absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>At last the Filipinos had left the rocks behind
and were circling around the swamp at the bottom
of the hollow. &ldquo;Now is the time to give &rsquo;em the
slip,&rdquo; whispered Luke, and crawled once more into
the open. Larry followed, and both hurried away
from the vicinity with all possible speed. It was
the last seen or heard of the party who had so
unexpectedly blockaded their progress on the highway.</p>
<p>The jungle at the top of the hill was as dense
as that below, and the pair had not proceeded far
before they found themselves in a veritable tangle
of bushes and vines. The bushes were of the
thorny kind peculiar to this locality, and more than
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
once Larry found himself caught and held as if in
a vice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My clothing will be in tatters if this keeps on,&rdquo;
he panted, as he cut himself loose with difficulty.
&ldquo;Did you ever see such a thicket!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We missed it when we started out to-night,&rdquo;
returned Luke, gravely. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve gone astray o&rsquo;
the firm&rsquo; line and everything else, to my way
o&rsquo; lookin&rsquo; at it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bad as was their situation, they felt it would be
worse with the coming of daylight. &ldquo;We must
get out of the enemy&rsquo;s territory before the sun
<a name='TC_3'></a><ins class='trchange' title="Changed single quote mark to double quote mark">rises,&rdquo;</ins> said Larry. &ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t, we&rsquo;ll have no
show at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But getting out was not easy; indeed, the farther
they advanced, the more difficult did it seem to
become, until both came to the conclusion that
they had missed their bearings entirely, and were
lost. &ldquo;And can&rsquo;t even see the stars to read &rsquo;em,&rdquo;
groaned Luke. &ldquo;Larry, we might as well make
the best of it, and wait for daylight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the youth demurred and insisted on going
ahead. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re bound to strike something soon,&rdquo;
he said, and did, immediately afterward. It was a
log lying on the edge of an incline, and down he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
pitched, and log and lad rolled over and over, with
Luke following, to bring up with a loud splash in
the river below.</p>
<p>The force of their fall took them under the surface
of the stream, and in the struggle to save
themselves both lost their cutlasses. But, as old
readers know, each could swim well, and they
speedily came up and struck out for the most
available landing-place, which was on the opposite
bank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Alto!</i>&rdquo; came the sudden cry, in Spanish.
&ldquo;Halt!&rdquo; And now a sentry appeared from behind
a pile of cord-wood lying but a short distance
away.</p>

&ldquo;Alto!&rdquo; came the sudden cry.&mdash;<i>Page 47.</i><br />
</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Discovered again,&rdquo; muttered Luke, and felt for
his pistol. &ldquo;Soaked!&rdquo; he muttered, in disgust.</p>
<p>The cry of the rebel on guard had given the
alarm to several others, and in a twinkling Larry
and the old Yankee tar found themselves confronted
by an even more determined crowd than
that encountered on the road. With the water
behind them, escape was out of the question, for a
jump back into the river would have courted a
fire which must have resulted in death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Americanos!</i>&rdquo; muttered one of the rebels, drawing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
closer. &ldquo;And sailors, not soldiers,&rdquo; he added,
in his native tongue. &ldquo;Where did you come from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Larry and Luke shook their heads. &ldquo;Talk
United States and we&rsquo;ll speak to you,&rdquo; said the
old sailor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You gif up?&rdquo; demanded an under officer, as
he pushed his way forward, with his pistol covering
Larry&rsquo;s heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t nuthin&rsquo; else to do, I reckon,&rdquo; replied Luke,
before Larry could answer. He was afraid the boy
might be rash and try running away again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Throw down de pistoles, den,&rdquo; muttered the
Tagal, with an ugly frown.</p>
<p>Down went the weapons on the ground, and
then two of the rebels advanced to search them.
They found nothing of special value excepting the
pair&rsquo;s jack-knives, and these were confiscated and
turned over to the officer in command.</p>
<p>The prisoners were then told to march up the
river shore to a road leading into Santa Cruz.
With their hands bound tightly behind them, they
were placed in charge of a detail of four Filipinos,
who were instructed to take them without delay
before the general in charge of the city&rsquo;s defences.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They may hold information of importance,&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
said the under officer. &ldquo;Do not delay a minute;&rdquo;
and off went the crowd, the soldiers prodding the
prisoners with their bayonets whenever Larry and
Luke did not walk fast enough to suit them.</p>
<p>The course taken was through a narrow and
exceedingly dirty street. It was after midnight,
yet the expected attack of the Americans had kept
all the inhabitants awake. The prisoners were
jeered at repeatedly, and at one point were covered
with a shower of mud and stale vegetables. The
onslaught might have been more serious had not
the soldiers interfered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get back, you dogs,&rdquo; shouted the leader, a little
Tagal scarcely five feet in height, but with an air
of magnificent importance. &ldquo;These men are to
go before the general, and at once!&rdquo; And much
abashed the natives fell back, and the prisoners
were molested no further.</p>
<p>It would naturally be supposed that the general
in command would be found at the front at such
a time, when an attack on the city was but a matter
of a few hours. Instead, however, General Bamodo
was found at one of the government buildings,
calmly smoking a cigar, and conversing with several
native business men.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Spies, eh?&rdquo; he queried, when the guard had told
him about the prisoners. &ldquo;Bring them in immediately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Larry and Luke were told to enter the room,
and did so, their still wet clothing forming little
puddles at their feet. The guards stood beside and
behind them. General Bamodo eyed them critically.
He spoke no English, and so called in an interpreter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you from?&rdquo; demanded the interpreter,
presently, after a few words with his
superior.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are from the warship <i>Olympia</i>,&rdquo; answered
Luke, briefly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were sent here by General Otis as spies,
not so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir, we are jest plain, everyday sailors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what brought you here?&rdquo; demanded the
interpreter, after translating their words to General
Bamodo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We missed our way on the road,&rdquo; put in Larry,
before Luke could answer. He thought it best not
to say anything about accompanying General Lawton&rsquo;s
expedition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must have missed it very much, General
Bamodo says,&rdquo; growled the interpreter, after another
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
consultation with his superior. &ldquo;Santa Cruz
is a good many miles from Manila harbor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this Larry remained silent, and another talk
in Spanish followed. Then a sudden shot from
a distance caused General Bamodo to leap to his
feet and dash down his cigar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take them to the prison&mdash;I will examine them
later on,&rdquo; he said, in Spanish, and hurried away.</p>
<p>A few minutes later Larry and his Yankee friend
were marched off, this time to a stone building
several squares away. Here they were taken inside,
thrust into a cell, the iron-barred door was locked
upon them, and they were left to their fate.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>IN WHICH LUKE STRIKER IS WOUNDED</h3>
</div>
<p>The plan to surprise Santa Cruz had failed, yet
General Lawton&rsquo;s command was just as eager as
ever to press forward and do battle with the native
garrison, of which the town on the Laguna de Bay
boasted. It was thought the Filipino command
could not be a strong one, and even if it had been
the Americans would have gone ahead just the
same, so accustomed were they to victory over their
misguided foes.</p>
<p>It was arranged that the centre and left wing
of the infantry should move directly upon the town,
while the right wing should swing around, to cut
off the Filipinos&rsquo; retreat, should they start such
a movement. In the meantime, protected by a
cross fire from the tinclads, <i>Laguna</i> and <i>Oeste</i>, the
cavalry landed on the hill overlooking the bay, and
began to do battle with the enemy&rsquo;s force in that
territory, cutting its way over field and brush to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
the left wing as it swung closer to the river already
mentioned several times. The cavalry developed
a strong resistance which lasted for over an hour;
but in the end the Filipinos were glad enough to
fall back into the town proper.</p>
<p>Out on the main road leading to the principal
bridge over the river the sun was boiling hot, and
many a soldier felt more like seeking shelter and
resting than like pushing forward with his heavy
gun and other equipments. But General Lawton
was here and there, encouraging every one, and they
pushed on until a sharp fire between the enemy and
the advance guard told that a running fight,
and perhaps a regular battle, would soon be at
hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At them, my men!&rdquo; cried the various commanders.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll run, no doubt of it. They
haven&rsquo;t stood up against us yet!&rdquo; And away went
the long skirmishing line, and soon there was a
steady crack and pop of guns and pistols as the
Americans pushed on, catching many a poor Filipino
who was too late in either running or throwing
down his arms. A number surrendered, and these
were promptly sent to the rear.</p>
<p>Presently the river was gained, and here the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
Americans came to an unexpected halt. There was
a long bridge to cross, and beyond was a barricade
of stone and wood. Were the insurgents massed
behind that barricade? If they were, to cross the
bridge in column of fours or otherwise would mean
a terrible slaughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here goes!&rdquo; sang out one petty officer, and
made a dash forward, which was as reckless as it
was daring. As he moved along the bridge several
held their breath, expecting to see him go down at
any instant. But then came a rush of first half
a dozen, then a score, and then whole companies,
and it was speedily seen that the barricade was
practically deserted. The insurgents were hurrying
into the town as hard as they could, with Uncle
Sam&rsquo;s men after them, both sides keeping up a
steady firing as they ran.</p>
<p>In the meantime, soaked to the skin and utterly
miserable over their capture, Larry and his Yankee
friend had been thrust into the prison cell and left
to themselves. After the door was locked and the
jailer walked away, the youth uttered a long-drawn
sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Luke, we&rsquo;re in a pickle, this trip,&rdquo; he groaned.
&ldquo;What do you suppose they will do with us?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Heaven alone knows, my lad,&rdquo; responded the
old tar. &ldquo;Bein&rsquo; as how they ain&rsquo;t cannibals, I don&rsquo;t
reckon they&rsquo;ll eat us up,&rdquo; and he smiled grimly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They think we are spies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thet&rsquo;s so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know that they shoot spies&mdash;and do it
in short order, too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why shouldn&rsquo;t I know it, Larry? I&rsquo;ve
heard tell on it often enough. But they have got to
prove we air spies first, ain&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll do what they please. I believe half of
these Filipinos think the Americans are nothing but
cut-throats. They can&rsquo;t conceive that we should
want to come here and govern them for their own
good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because they would rather govern themselves,
even if they made a mess of it, than be under anybody&rsquo;s
thumb nail, Larry. Howsomever, thet ain&rsquo;t
the p&rsquo;int jest now. The p&rsquo;int is, kin we git out o&rsquo;
here before they settle to do wuss with us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get out? You mean break jail?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly. We don&rsquo;t want to stay here if we kin
git out, do we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure not.&rdquo; Larry leaped up from the
bench upon which he had been resting and ran to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
the door. At this Luke smiled glumly and shook
his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye won&rsquo;t go it thet way, lad&mdash;the guard locked
it, I seen him do it,&mdash;and the lock is a strong one,
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Luke was right, as a brief examination proved.
Then the boy turned to the window, an affair less
than a foot square, having over it several iron bars
set firmly into the stones. &ldquo;No thoroughfare
there,&rdquo; was his comment.</p>
<p>The two next examined the floor, to find it of
brick, and as solid as the walls. &ldquo;Only the ceilin&rsquo;
left now,&rdquo; said Luke. &ldquo;I reckon we might as well
give it up. Even if we do git out, more&rsquo;n likely a
guard outside will shoot us down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Larry was determined to test the ceiling,
which was but a couple of feet over their heads. So
he had his companion hold him for that purpose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a loose board up there,&rdquo; he cried, as he
was feeling his way along. &ldquo;Hold me a little
higher, Luke, and perhaps I can shove it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old sailor did as requested, and with a strong
push Larry shifted one end of the plank above, so
that it left an opening ten inches wide and several
feet long. Catching a good hold he pulled himself
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
to the apartment above, to find it stored with boxes
and barrels containing old military uniforms and
other army equipments, relics of Spanish rule.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any way out up thar?&rdquo; queried Luke. &ldquo;If
there is, we don&rsquo;t want to waste any time, ye
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you in a minute,&rdquo; replied Larry, in a low
voice, and ran first to one end window of the storeroom
and then the other. In front was the street,
fast filling with soldiers. In the rear was a stable
which just now seemed deserted. The several windows
of the storeroom were all barred, but here the
bars were screwed fast to wood instead of being set
in stone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think there is a chance here,&rdquo; said the boy,
coming back to the opening. &ldquo;Here, give me your
hand, and I&rsquo;ll help you up,&rdquo; and he bent down; and
soon Luke stood beside him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think we can git out thet way, eh!&rdquo; said the
Yankee tar, surveying the prospect in the rear.
&ldquo;Well, I reckon it&rsquo;s worth workin&rsquo; for, Larry. But
the drop from the window, even if we pull away the
bars&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is a rope&mdash;we can use that,&rdquo; answered the
boy, pointing out the article around several small
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
boxes. While Luke pried away the bars of one of
the rear windows he possessed himself of the rope,
and tied it fast to a bar which was not disturbed.
As soon as the opening was sufficiently large to
admit of the passage of each one&rsquo;s body, Luke
swung himself over the window-sill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; he cried softly, and slipped from
view. Never had he gone down a ship&rsquo;s rope
quicker, and never had Larry followed his friend
with such alacrity. Both felt that life or death
depended upon the rapidity of their movements.</p>
<p>The ground was hardly touched by Luke when a
Filipino boy appeared at the entrance to the stable.
For an instant the youth stared in opened-mouthed
astonishment, then he uttered a yell that would have
done credit to an Indian on the war-path.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The jig&rsquo;s up!&rdquo; cried the Yankee tar. &ldquo;Come,
Larry, our legs have got to save us, if we&rsquo;re to be
saved at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He leaped across the yard and for the corner of
the stable, where he collided with a Tagal soldier,
who was coming forward to learn what the yelling
meant. Down went both the sailor and the guard;
but the rebel got the worse of it, for he lay half
stunned, while Luke was up in a trice. As the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
soldier fell, his gun flew from his hands, and Larry
tarried just long enough to pick the weapon up.</p>
<p>Behind the stable was a narrow, winding street,
lined on either side with huts and other native
dwellings, with here and there a barnlike warehouse.
Into this street darted our two friends, and
there paused, not knowing whether to move toward
the wharves or in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out!&rdquo; suddenly yelled Larry, and dropped
flat, followed by the Yankee tar. A sharp report
rang out, and a bullet whistled over their heads,
coming from the prison yard. On the instant Larry
fired in return, and the prison guard disappeared as
if by magic. Long afterward, Larry learned that
he had hit the Tagal in the arm.</p>
<p>There was now a general alarm throughout the
prison, and the two escaped prisoners felt that any
other locality would be better for them than the one
they now occupied. &ldquo;Let us try to find our soldiers,&rdquo;
said Luke, and once again they started to
run, this time up the road where, far away, they
could make out a forest of some sort. Then came a
second report, and Luke Striker staggered back, hit
in the shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Luke! Luke, you are struck!&rdquo; gasped Larry.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
His heart seemed to leap into his throat. What if
his dearest friend had been mortally wounded?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;reckon it&mdash;it ain&rsquo;t much!&rdquo; came with
a shiver. The sailor straightened himself up and
started to run again. &ldquo;They are after us hot-like,
ain&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A turn in the road soon took them out of sight of
the prison, and they breathed a bit more freely. But
the strain was beginning to tell upon Luke, and
watching him, Larry saw that he was growing
deathly pale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t keep this up, Luke,&rdquo; he said, and put
out his arm to aid his friend. As he did so, the
Yankee tar gave a short groan, threw up both hands,
and then sank down in a heap at the boy&rsquo;s feet.</p>
<hr class='toprule' />

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>THE RETREAT TO THE RICE-HOUSE</h3>
</div>
<p>Larry was greatly alarmed, not knowing but that
his companion was about to die on his hands.
Quickly he knelt at the Yankee&rsquo;s side, to learn that
Luke had fainted away from loss of blood. The
shoulder of his shirt and jacket were saturated
through and through.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall I do?&rdquo; the boy asked himself, and
gazed hurriedly at the surroundings. To one side
of the road were several nipa huts, to the other
a long, rambling warehouse. The doorways of all
the buildings stood open, and no one seemed to be
in sight.</p>
<p>As quickly as he could the youth took up his
friend and staggered with his heavy burden to the
warehouse, which was about half filled with rice.
Entering the structure, he passed to a small apartment
somewhat in the rear. Here there was a quantity
of old sacking in a heap, and upon this rude
couch Larry placed the unconscious form.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span></div>
<p>The boy had been taught on shipboard just what
to do in case of such an emergency, and now he
worked as he never had before, for Luke was very
dear to him, and the thought that his friend might
die was horrible to contemplate. He prayed to
Heaven that the old gunner&rsquo;s life might be spared
to him.</p>
<p>The wound was an ugly one; yet even to Larry&rsquo;s
inexperienced eye it did not look as if it could be
fatal, and the boy breathed a long sigh of relief as he
bound it up. Then he went in search of water, and
finding a well back of the warehouse brought a
bucketful in and began to bathe Luke. Soon the
sufferer stirred and opened his honest eyes wonderingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;er&mdash;how&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; he stammered. &ldquo;Did
I&mdash;oh, I remember now!&rdquo; And he sank back
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep quiet,&rdquo; whispered the boy. He had heard
voices coming toward the warehouse. &ldquo;If you
make a sound, it may be all up with both of
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old tar breathed heavily and nodded. Throwing
some sacking over the prostrate form, Larry
slipped back into the main apartment of the warehouse.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
He still held the gun, but it was empty and
could be used only as a club.</p>
<p>Two men were approaching the warehouse, both
tall, slim, and evidently of Spanish extraction.
They were talking loudly and excitedly to one
another; but as Larry understood but few words of
Spanish, what they were saying was lost upon the
boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe they are after us,&rdquo; thought the
lad, when the strangers came to a halt just outside
the warehouse. As they did so a long volley of rifle
shots came from a distance, followed by another and
then another. The shooting came from the centre of
the town and made Larry&rsquo;s heart beat fast. &ldquo;Our
soldiers must be coming in,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;Oh, I
hope they make the town ours!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The shots appeared to disturb the two Spaniards
greatly, for both clutched each other by the arm and
looked thoroughly frightened.</p>
<p>Presently an old woman came running out of
one of the huts. She yelled at the two Spaniards
in her own tongue and pointed at the warehouse.
Evidently she had seen Larry and Luke, but had
been afraid to expose herself.</p>
<p>The strangers listened to the old woman with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
interest, then began to talk to each other. &ldquo;Perhaps
we can get some information, Jos&eacute;,&rdquo; said one,
in Spanish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we shall get a bullet,&rdquo; answered his
companion, grimly. Nevertheless, he consented to
enter the building, and both passed through the
great doorway of the warehouse.</p>
<p>Hardly knowing how to receive the newcomers,
Larry stepped for a moment behind a bin of rice.
But then, as the pair moved toward where Luke
lay, he raised his gun threateningly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Halt!&rdquo; he called, as sternly as he could.
&ldquo;Halt, or I shall fire!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are betrayed!&rdquo; roared one of the Spaniards,
in his native tongue. &ldquo;No shoot! no shoot!&rdquo; he
added, in broken English. &ldquo;We mean you no
harm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up with your hands, then,&rdquo; went on Larry,
resolved to make the most of the situation, even
though the gun was empty; and four hands went
promptly into the air, for the two men before him
were as cowardly as they were unprincipled.</p>
<p>There was an awkward silence for several seconds,
while boy and men surveyed each other.
Larry lowered the gun slightly, but still kept his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
finger on the trigger. He noted that the newcomers
appeared to be unarmed, although they had
both knives and pistols hidden upon their persons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are an <i>Americano</i> sailor, not so?&rdquo; asked
one of the Spaniards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; was Larry&rsquo;s prompt reply. &ldquo;Are you
one of Aguinaldo&rsquo;s rebels?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no! We are no rebels&mdash;we are peaceful
Spanish gentlemen,&rdquo; put in the second Spaniard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you belong here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I belong here,&rdquo; said the man who had first
spoken. &ldquo;My brother, he belongs at Manila.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The brother mentioned shot an angry glance at
the speaker. &ldquo;Yes, I come from Manila,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;But I belong truly in Spain, being a merchant of
Madrid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, our war with you folks is over,&rdquo; said
Larry, slowly, hardly knowing how to proceed.
&ldquo;If you are not going to help the rebels, you ought
to help us. We are doing all we can for your prisoners
out here,&rdquo; he added, meaning the Spaniards
that were being held by the forces under General
Aguinaldo&mdash;soldiers who were captured during the
struggle between Spain and her Philippine colonies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can do but little,&rdquo; came with a shrug of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
the shoulders. &ldquo;We are not armed, and if we
help the <i>Americanos</i>, Aguinaldo says he will behead
all the Spanish prisoners he is holding.&rdquo; Such a
threat was actually made, but it is doubtful if the
Filipinos would have been base enough to carry
it out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We came in here not to make trouble,&rdquo; went
on the second Spaniard. &ldquo;We came to learn what
the firing means. Are the <i>Americanos</i> coming here
in force?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then Santa Cruz is doomed,&rdquo; groaned the Spaniard.
He dropped his hands and began to pace the
warehouse floor. &ldquo;I shall lose much if the city
falls. The rebels will burn all my property, for
they hate me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I trust not,&rdquo; answered Larry, his fear of the
pair gradually leaving him. &ldquo;Hark to that!&rdquo;
he added, as the rattle of guns was again heard.
&ldquo;Our men must be coming in fast, and orders are
to save everything that can be saved. If the
rebels&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He broke off short as a cry from Luke reached
him. Running to the Yankee sailor he found Luke
kicking out vigorously with his foot.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t keep still no longer, nohow!&rdquo; burst
out the old tar. &ldquo;A plagued rat came right up
and wanted to nibble my leg, hang him. Who&rsquo;s
them air fellows out thar?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the Spaniards had already followed Larry,
and were now gazing at Luke in wonder.
&ldquo;Wounded, not so?&rdquo; said one. &ldquo;You were in
the fight, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we escaped from the prison,&rdquo; answered
Larry, simply. &ldquo;We were captured during last
night. I wish I was sure we&rsquo;d be safe here until
our soldiers come along.&rdquo; He turned to the old
sailor again. &ldquo;How do you feel now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better, Larry, a heap better. But I ain&rsquo;t ready
fer no more foot races jest yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll have to remain here. Or perhaps
you had better remain here while I go scouting
around and see if I can find some of our soldiers, or
the ambulance corps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; what o&rsquo; these gentlemen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall go, too,&rdquo; said one of the Spaniards.
&ldquo;Your friend will be safe here&mdash;if he keeps hidden
under the sacks,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>Waiting for the strangers to move first, Larry
came behind them, still holding the gun as though
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
the weapon were ready for use. The men had
spoken fairly enough, yet there was that about
them which did not please Larry in the least.
&ldquo;They are regular rascals, or else I miss my
guess,&rdquo; thought the youth.</p>
<p>The roadway still seemed deserted. But far off
they could see the natives flying in several directions.
Then from a distance came a cheer which
Larry knew could only come from American
throats.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our soldiers must be over there,&rdquo; he said to
the Spaniards. &ldquo;Will you come with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The men hesitated, and consulted together in
their native tongue. &ldquo;I do not know what to
say,&rdquo; said one, slowly, and began to follow Larry
along the highway. Seeing this, the other came,
too.</p>
<p>Suddenly a loud shout came to them from a
thicket back of some nipa huts, and instantly a
band of insurgents burst into view, armed with
guns and bolos. They were firing as they retreated,
and made a stand on the opposite side of the road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jos&eacute; Lupez!&rdquo; cried one of the officers of the
rebels, addressing one of the two Spaniards.
&ldquo;What do you here?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;And have I no right here?&rdquo; asked the Spaniard,
sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is that with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My brother, Benedicto, from Manila, who was
visiting me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has betrayed us into the hands of the <i>Americanos</i>!
If he&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rest of the sentence was drown out in a
volley of musketry, and two rebels were seen to fall.
Some started to run, but others held their ground.</p>
<p>Larry listened in amazement. He had heard the
names Jos&eacute; Lupez and Benedicto, and knew that
the two Spaniards were brothers. Could this Spaniard,
Benedicto Lupez, be the man who had made off
with the money Braxton Bogg had stolen from the
Hearthstone Saving Institution?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>A PRISONER OF THE FILIPINOS</h3>
</div>
<p>Larry had retreated to a small nipa hut standing
close to the roadway, feeling that if the Americans
were coming in that direction, they would soon be at
hand to give Luke and himself aid.</p>
<p>While the insurgents and the Spaniards were conversing,
the latter had approached the hut, and now
both followed the young sailor inside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is your name Benedicto Lupez?&rdquo; demanded
Larry, approaching the taller of the pair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; was the short response.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you are from Manila&mdash;you ran away from
there about two weeks ago?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! what do you know of that?&rdquo; demanded
the Spaniard, eying Larry darkly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know a good deal about you,&rdquo; answered the
youth, boldly. &ldquo;After Braxton Bogg was arrested
you made off with the money he had left at your
residence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis false!&rdquo; roared the Spaniard, but his face
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
blanched even as he spoke. &ldquo;I know nothing of
that man or his money. I&mdash;I was deceived in
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that is so, why did you leave Manila in such
a hurry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I wanted to help my brother, who was in
trouble. I have not seen a dollar of Bogg&rsquo;s money.
&rsquo;Tis he who still owes me for his board, black
wretch that he was!&rdquo; roared Benedicto Lupez,
savagely.</p>
<p>At these words Larry was startled. Was Lupez
really telling the truth, and if so, where was the
money that had wrecked the saving institution?</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t even pay his board?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not one piaster, boy,&mdash;nothing. And I thought
him honest, or I would not have taken him in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But his valise is gone, and the bands around the
money&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were as he left them. I can swear I touched
absolutely nothing,&rdquo; answered Benedicto Lupez,
earnestly.</p>
<p>Larry was nonplussed. Had the Spaniard looked
less of a villain, the young sailor would have been
inclined to believe him. But that face was so crafty
and calculating that he still hesitated.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you are innocent, you will not object to
helping me rejoin our soldiers,&rdquo; he ventured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want nothing to do with the <i>Americanos</i>,&mdash;they
mean to get me into trouble, even though I am
innocent,&rdquo; growled Benedicto Lupez. &ldquo;Come, Jos&eacute;,
we will go,&rdquo; he added to his brother, in their native
language.</p>
<p>His brother was already at the doorway. The
shouting and firing outside was increasing. Leaping
forward, Larry caught Benedicto Lupez by the
arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll stay here,&rdquo; he began, when the Spaniard
let out a heavy blow which hurled the young sailor
flat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not be held by a boy!&rdquo; cried the man.
&ldquo;Let go, do you hear?&rdquo; For Larry had caught him
by the foot. The boy&rsquo;s hold was good, and in a trice
Benedicto Lupez lay flat on his back. Then he rolled
over and over and a fierce tussle ensued, which came
to a sudden end when Jos&eacute; Lupez leaped forward
and kicked Larry in the head, rendering him partly
unconscious.</p>
<p>What followed was more like a dream than reality
to the bruised youth. He heard a confused murmur
of voices and a dozen or more shots, and then, as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
Benedicto Lupez and his brother ran off, several rebels
swarmed into the hut, one stumbling over the lad&rsquo;s
form and pitching headlong. This insurgent was
about to knife Larry when he saw that the young
sailor&rsquo;s eyes were closed, and that he was bleeding
about the head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Un Americano</i>, and wounded,&rdquo; he said, speaking
in the Tagalog dialect. &ldquo;If he lives, he may make
us a useful prisoner;&rdquo; and a few minutes later Larry
felt himself picked up and borne away, first in a
man&rsquo;s arms and then on horseback. He tried to
&ldquo;locate&rdquo; himself, but when he opened his eyes all
went swimming before them, and he was glad enough
to sink back once more and shut out the swirling
sight.</p>
<p>On and on, and still on went the rebels, some on
foot and a few on their steeds. In front were a few
wagons and caribao carts piled high with camping
outfits, and also one or two light guns&mdash;all that had
been saved from the garrison. General Lawton&rsquo;s
attack had been a brilliant success, and Santa Cruz
itself had surrendered with hardly the loss of a man
to the Americans. The troops coming in did their
best to round up the insurgents, but they had scattered
in all directions and only a few were caught,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
and these swore that they were <i>amigos</i>, or friends,
and had to be given their liberty. This pretending
to be friends after they were routed was a great trick
with thousands of the natives. They would come
into the American camp under the pretext that they
had just escaped from the insurgents who had threatened
to kill them if they would not join Aguinaldo&rsquo;s
forces. What to do with such people was one of the
most difficult problems of the rebellion. They could
not be placed under arrest, and yet that is what nine
out of ten deserved.</p>
<p>When Larry was once more himself he found that
it was night. He was in a heap in a large casco
which several Tagals were propelling with all speed
across the Laguna de Bay. There were several
other cascos in front and behind, all filled with
natives with guns. The entire procession moved
along in almost utter silence.</p>
<p>The youth wanted to know where he was being
taken, but no sooner did he open his mouth than one
of the soldiers clapped a dirty hand over it and commanded
him to be silent. As the soldier carried a
bolo in his hand, Larry considered &ldquo;discretion the
better part of valor,&rdquo; and for the time being, held
his peace.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span></div>
<p>A swarm of mosquitoes soon told the boy that
they were approaching a marsh, and presently the
casco ran in between the reeds and under some high,
overhanging tropical bushes. Then those on board
leaped ashore, and the youth was made to follow
them.</p>
<p>A weary tramp over the marsh and then up a high
hill followed. The hill was covered with wild plantains,
monstrous ferns, and a species of cedar tree,
all thickly interlaced with the ever present tropical
vines, which crossed and recrossed the tortuous path
the party was following. Overhead the stars shone
down dimly, while the forest was filled with the
cries of the birds, the chattering of an occasional
monkey, and the constant drone and chirp of the
innumerable insects. The path was uneven, and
more than once Larry pitched into a hollow along
with the Tagal who accompanied him and who never
let go his hold on the youthful prisoner.</p>
<p>At last they came to a halt before a series of rocks.
Here there was a rude cave, partly concealed by
bushes. As the party halted, several natives came
from the cave to give them welcome. There was no
doubt but that this was a rendezvous well known to
the insurgents.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;A prisoner is it?&rdquo; said one of the natives, coming
forward and holding up a torch of pitch. &ldquo;A mere
boy. Bah, Lanza, cannot you do better?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was with the soldiers who took Santa Cruz,
and he wears the cap from a warship,&rdquo; replied Lanza.
&ldquo;It may be we can get more out of him than out of
somebody older.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, perhaps; but I would rather you had
brought in a man,&rdquo; was the brief response.</p>
<p>The conversation was in the Tagalog dialect, and
consequently Larry did not understand a word of it.
The boy was made to march into the cave, which he
found to be much larger than he expected. It was
fully forty feet broad by sixty feet deep, and at the
farther end a bright fire was burning, the blaze
mounting high up in a natural chimney and rendering
the surroundings as light almost as day.</p>
<p>On coming to his senses, the youth&rsquo;s hands had
been bound behind him, and now he was made to sit
down with his back against a fair-sized tree trunk
which had been dragged into the cave for firewood.
A rope was passed around the log and this in turn
was fastened to the cord about his wrists, thus making
him a close prisoner.</p>
<p>For several hours the rebels paid but scant attention
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
to him, further than to furnish him a bowl of rice
&ldquo;pap,&rdquo; from which he might sup while it was held
to his lips. They also gave him a drink of water,
and one young rebel considerately washed the wound
on his head, on which the blood had dried, presenting
anything but a pleasant sight.</p>
<p>As the hours went by the rebels around the cave
kept increasing in numbers until there were several
hundred all told. Those who came in last told of
the complete downfall of Santa Cruz, but none of
them had the least idea of what the Americans were
going to do next. &ldquo;Perhaps they will follow us to
here,&rdquo; said one, grimly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, they know better than to follow us into the
jungles and mountains,&rdquo; said the leader, Fipile. &ldquo;If
they did that, we could shoot them down like so many
monkeys.&rdquo; They had still to learn the true character
of the tireless general who had now taken up their
trail, and who knew no such words as fear or failure.</p>
<p>It was well toward noon of the day following
when Captain Fipile came in to have a talk with
Larry. He spoke English remarkably well, for he
had spent several years of his life in San Francisco,
and in Hong Kong among the English located at
that port.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Your name, my boy,&rdquo; he said, sitting down
beside the young tar. And when Larry had given
it, he continued, &ldquo;You were with the American
troops who carried Santa Cruz?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was, sir, although I got into the city before
they did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, and how was that?&rdquo; questioned the
Filipino leader, and Larry told as much of his story
as he deemed necessary.</p>
<p>To the tale Captain Fipile listened with interest,
even smiling when Larry told how he had broken
out of the prison. &ldquo;You did wonderfully well for
a boy,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;A man could not have done
more. What became of your friend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I left him at the warehouse. I hope he rejoined
the soldiers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what of Se&ntilde;ors Benedicto and Jos&eacute; Lupez?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what became of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know this Jos&eacute; Lupez fairly well, and I always
thought him an honest man.&rdquo; Captain Fipile stroked
his chin thoughtfully. &ldquo;We are fighting you Americans,
it is true, but we would not wish to shelter a
thief who had run away from among you. We are
above that, even though a good many of your countrymen
will not give us credit for it.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;We know that some of the Filipinos are honest
enough,&rdquo; said Larry, hesitatingly. &ldquo;What do you
intend to do with me?&rdquo; he went on, after a pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That remains to be seen. Would you like to
join our army?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me? No, sir!&rdquo; cried the youth, promptly.</p>
<p>Captain Fipile laughed outright. &ldquo;You are honest
enough about it, I must say. How about giving us
a little information? Will you object to that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have given you considerable information
already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean military information.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t anything to say on that point.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I persuade you to tell me what you may
happen to know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I can get you to talk, it may go much easier
with you while you remain our prisoner,&rdquo; went on
the captain, suggestively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, but I haven&rsquo;t anything to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, then, Master Russell, if you are rather
harshly treated in the future, remember you have
only yourself to blame. As a general rule, we take
prisoners only for the purpose of squeezing what
information we can out of them.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span></div>
<p>And thus speaking, Captain Fipile arose and
quitted the cave, leaving Larry to his own reflections,
which were more dismal than they were
encouraging.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>THE ADVANCE INTO THE JUNGLE</h3>
</div>
<p>Santa Cruz had been taken, but there was
still much to do around the shores of the Laguna
de Bay to make it safe territory for the Americans
to hold. From the city the rebels were pursued
eastward, and a number of cascos and larger boats
were captured. Inside of a few days Paete, Longos,
Lumban, and several other villages, were
visited by detachments of General Lawton&rsquo;s command,
and the insurgents fled in each instance,
leaving all behind them. Nearly a hundred who
stopped to fight were either killed or wounded,
and victory was entirely upon the side of the
Americans.</p>
<p>But now it was learned that the forces under
General Aguinaldo and General Luna were concentrating
once more to the north and east of
Malolos, and much as he regretted the necessity,
General Otis was compelled to order General Lawton
and his command back to the territory above
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
Manila. No garrisons could be spared for Santa
Cruz, or the other places captured, so these settlements
were allowed to fall once more into the hands
of the enemy, after all the fortifications had been
destroyed and the arms and munitions of war confiscated.
It seemed a pity to leave these towns
and villages after having once taken them, but to
garrison them properly would, according to General
Lawton&rsquo;s estimate, have taken thousands of
soldiers.</p>
<p>With the taking of Santa Cruz, the Americans
marched through all the streets and by-ways, looking
for lurking rebels and hidden arms, and in
this search a squad of infantry came upon Luke
Striker, who had propped himself up on the sacking
in the warehouse and was making himself as
comfortable as possible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo, sailor,&rdquo; cried the sergeant in charge of
the squad. &ldquo;Where did you come from?&rdquo;</p>
<div class='figtag'>
<a name='linki_4' id='linki_4'></a>
</div>
<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/illus096.jpg' alt='' title='' width='335' height='500' /><br />
<p class='caption'>
&ldquo;Hullo, sailor, where did you come from?&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Page 82.</i><br />
</p>
</div>
<p>Luke&rsquo;s story was quickly told, and he begged
the soldier to look for Larry, fearing that serious
harm had befallen the lad. At once two soldiers
were detailed to care for the old Yankee, while
the rest went on a hunt which lasted far into the
night.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span></div>
<p>As we know, nothing was seen of Larry; but
from a wounded and dying Filipino, the soldiers
learned that the boy had been taken a prisoner,
and must now be many miles away from the city.
News of this reached Luke while he was in the
temporary hospital opened up after the first fight,
and the information made the old fellow feel as
bad as did his wound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they&rsquo;ve captured him, he&rsquo;s a goner, I&rsquo;m
afraid,&rdquo; he said to Jack Biddle, who had come
in to help look after his messmate. &ldquo;Poor Larry!
What will his brother Ben say, when he hears of
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better not tell him right away,&rdquo; suggested
Biddle. &ldquo;Give him a chance to get strong fust.
Besides, Larry may give &rsquo;em the slip. He&rsquo;s putty
cute, ye know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The news soon spread that Larry and several
others were missing, and a description of the absent
ones was given out. The next day one of the
missing soldiers was found dead in the jungle, but
nothing was learned of the others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It serves the young sailor right,&rdquo; growled Lieutenant
Horitz. &ldquo;He knew too much for his own
good.&rdquo; He had not forgotten the disaster on the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
river, and secretly he wished Larry all manner of
ill-luck. During the rush through the woods the
Lieutenant had tumbled and struck his nose on a
stone. That member was much swollen and cut
in consequence, and this put him in a worse humor
than ever before.</p>
<p>By the time the expedition was to return to
Manila, Luke was able to walk around again, and
he was put on one of the larger boats and Jack
Biddle was detailed to look after him. The return
to Manila was made without special incident, and
two days later found Luke on board the <i>Olympia</i>
among all his old friends.</p>
<p>But the Yankee tar was thoroughly out of sorts.
&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t care for the wound at all, if only I
knew Larry was safe,&rdquo; he was wont to say a dozen
times a day. Barrow, Castleton, and all the boy&rsquo;s
old friends were likewise troubled because of his
strange disappearance.</p>
<p>It was Jack Biddle who got shore leave and
travelled up to Malolos to break the news to Ben.
He found the acting captain of Company D just
preparing to take his place in the command once
more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to see you lookin&rsquo; well, leftenant,&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
he said, after shaking hands warmly. &ldquo;Ye look
almost as healthy as ye did on the voyage from
Brooklyn to Manila.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I feel almost as well,&rdquo; replied Ben. &ldquo;The
rest has done me a world of good. But what
brought you up, Jack? Did Larry come with
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Larry didn&rsquo;t come,&rdquo; stammered the old tar,
and looked down at the floor. &ldquo;Fact is, leftenant,
Larry&mdash;he&mdash;he couldn&rsquo;t come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t come? Why, what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;
cried Ben, quickly. &ldquo;Is he sick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon not&mdash;leas&rsquo;wise, I don&rsquo;t know. Fact
is, leftenant, none on us know. Ye see, he went
upon thet Santa Cruz expedition&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, I know that. And what of it? Was
he&mdash;was he&mdash;&rdquo; Ben could not utter the words
which came to his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he wasn&rsquo;t shot, thet is, so far as we know.
But he&rsquo;s&mdash;well, he&rsquo;s missin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; we can&rsquo;t find hide
nor hair o&rsquo; him anywhere. I might ez well tell
ye fust ez last, though it cuts my heart to do
it, leftenant.&rdquo; And Jack Biddle shook his head
dubiously.</p>
<p>It was a great shock to Ben, yet he stood it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
better than the old tar had expected. He asked
immediately for details, and though he drank in
every word his manner showed that his thoughts
were far away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I had been along,&rdquo; he said bitterly.
&ldquo;If he wasn&rsquo;t killed, the Filipinos must have carried
him off a pretty good distance. I wonder if
General Lawton tried to find out anything under
a flag of truce.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything that could be done was done&mdash;I
have Captain Gaston&rsquo;s word on that,&rdquo; answered
Jack Biddle. Captain Gaston and Ben were well
known to each other.</p>
<p>Ben sank down on a bench, and for several
minutes said not a word, but the tears stood in
his eyes, tears which he hastily dried that nobody
might see them. Then Gilbert Pennington came
in, to tell him that the regiment was ordered to
move within the hour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too bad!&rdquo; declared the young Southerner.
&ldquo;But brace up, Ben, &lsquo;While there is life there is
hope,&rsquo; and it&rsquo;s a pretty sure thing that he wasn&rsquo;t
killed.&rdquo; And with this ray of comfort Ben had
to be content.</p>
<p>During the days that General Lawton had been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
in the vicinity of the Laguna de Bay, the regiment
to which Ben and Gilbert belonged had not been
idle. With a number of other troops they started
for the town of Santa Maria, where they came
upon the enemy and dislodged them with shells.
The town, already in flames, was allowed to burn,
and the Americans pursued the rebels quite a distance
into the mountains, but failed to catch
them.</p>
<p>In the meantime the camp of the Third Artillery,
situated some distance to the west of Malolos, was
attacked. A fierce engagement in the swamps
took place, and in the end the rebels were driven
northward and began then to concentrate at Tarlac,
which soon became one of their new capitals&mdash;they
shifting the seat of government as often
as it suited their convenience.</p>
<p>It was now felt by General Otis and others in
command that no time should be lost in an endeavor
to round up the insurgents to the north
of Malolos, who were the main support of the
rebellion, although scattering bands were still
operating to the south and southeast. The rainy
season was but a few weeks off, and once this set
in military operations would be much retarded, if
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
not stopped altogether, for, taken as a whole, the
roads throughout the Island of Luzon are bad, and
heavy rains render them well-nigh impassable.</p>
<p>In order to make the campaign against the
rebels as effective as possible, General Otis decided
to send out two columns, one under General
MacArthur to strike out for Calumpit, and the
second, under General Lawton, to take a route
to the eastward, along the base of the hills leading
to San Isidro. By this it was hoped, if the rebels
at Calumpit were defeated and tried to take to
the mountains, they would fall directly into Lawton&rsquo;s
hands, and not only have to surrender but
also give up all their war supplies.</p>
<p>It was in the furtherance of this plan that General
Lawton left Manila with his brigade and struck
out for Novaliches which was gained after a small
skirmish at Tuliahan River. From here the column
moved to Norzagaray to await re&euml;nforcements
which were coming in from Malolos and vicinity.
To these re&euml;nforcements belonged the command to
which Ben and Gilbert were attached.</p>
<p>It had begun to rain, and those who understood
tropical weather predicted that the wet season was
at hand. Yet it was very hot, and the water
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
which fell arose in clouds of steam on the road,
rendering marching anything but comfortable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, an&rsquo; it makes a man feel as if he was
takin&rsquo; a stame bath, so it does,&rdquo; remarked Dan
Casey, as he swung along on the route step. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t know as I iver see it rain hot wather before,
bedad,&rdquo; he added, as he wiped the perspiration
from his sadly freckled face.</p>
<p>During the day&rsquo;s march, which was trying to
everybody, Ben was silent, wondering what had
become of Larry and if he would ever again see his
younger brother. When the command went into
camp under the shelter of a grove of tall trees, both
Gilbert and Major Morris visited his tent to
comfort him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is not the only one who is missing,&rdquo; remarked
the major of the first battalion. &ldquo;So far I understand
the warships have lost about a dozen men who
went ashore and failed to return. And you know
there are six men missing from our own regiment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is true, major,&rdquo; was the acting captain&rsquo;s
answer. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s only when it&rsquo;s a close relative
that the blow really comes home to one, you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose that is true, captain. But don&rsquo;t be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
disheartened. It may be that your brother is already
back at Manila.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see what the rebels would do with him
as a prisoner,&rdquo; said Gilbert. &ldquo;They have to move
around so lively that I can&rsquo;t see what they want
with prisoners anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so the talk ran on until it came time to retire.
That night Ben slept but little, and it was not the
rain or the aching of his wound that kept him awake
either. He was bound to think of Larry constantly
until something was heard of the missing lad.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>THE TAKING OF ANGAT</h3>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;We are out for a fight to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Sergeant Gilmore who spoke, and he
addressed Ben. The sergeant was still acting as
first lieutenant of Company D, and it looked as if he
might hold the position permanently. As for Ben,
it was settled that he would be appointed permanent
captain of the command as soon as the necessary
papers could be made out.</p>
<p>The regiment had joined General Lawton&rsquo;s command
and was now in the vicinity of Angat, a pretty
town, full of quaint buildings, and a place which, as
yet, the rebellion had scarcely touched. But the
insurgents had been developed in force by the sharpshooters
in front, and now a constant rattle of
musketry was heard, which made Ben&rsquo;s blood tingle
as of old, when the cry had been, &ldquo;On to Santiago!&rdquo;
and &ldquo;On to Malolos!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you are right, Gilmore,&rdquo; answered the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
young captain. &ldquo;And I am not sorry. It will help
us to forget the rain and our other discomforts.&rdquo;
Ben did not say it would help him to forget about
Larry, but that is what he meant.</p>
<p>The regiment was soon advancing on the double-quick.
It was spread out in skirmish order, and the
route lay over what had once been a rice-field, but
which was but little more than a sheet of dirty
water four to eight inches deep. Here and there
were holes, and into these some of the soldiers would
sometimes step, thus getting an involuntary bath,
much to their disgust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t all a picnic,&rdquo; remarked one of the unfortunates,
as he leaped up out of a hole and shook
himself like a big dog. &ldquo;Folks at home as just
read the newspaper accounts of the war don&rsquo;t know
anything of what us fellows have to put up with.
All they think we do is to rush forward, kill the
enemy, and cover ourselves with glory. I&rsquo;ll wager
some of &rsquo;em would put on a mighty sour face if they
had to tramp ten or twenty miles in the mud and
wet, carry a gun and other luggage, and hardly
knowing when the next meal was going to turn up
and what it was going to amount to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;ve got &rsquo;em bad, Bradner!&rdquo; shouted a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
comrade. &ldquo;Here, light my pipe and take a smoke.
It will dry off your nose if nothing else.&rdquo; And
Bradner took the pipe and was thankful that tobacco,
at least, was still forthcoming.</p>
<p>Half an hour later Ben received orders to take his
company up to the firing line, and away went the
command on the double-quick, with the young
captain at the head. The rain had let up a bit, and
the rebels could be seen making a stand behind a
grove of half-wild plantains, where were located a
score of nipa huts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Run them out, boys!&rdquo; shouted Ben, as they
drew closer. &ldquo;If we go at them with a rush we&rsquo;ll
soon have them on the run!&rdquo; And on swept the
company, with orders to fire at will. Soon there
was a constant cracking of rifles, and Ben and the
other officers joined in with their pistols. The
insurgents fired in return, and one man of the
company fell back, hit in the arm.</p>
<p>Just before the grove was gained there was
a brook to cross. This was much swollen, and
here a number of the soldiers came to a halt,
fearing that fording was out of the question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stop!&rdquo; came in a loud cry from Major
Morris. &ldquo;You can leap the stream easily enough.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
Come, I&rsquo;m going!&rdquo; And over he went with
a bound, and a score of soldiers followed. A raking
fire came from the nipa huts, but now the
rebels were seen to be fleeing. The Americans
answered the fire with volley after volley from
their own guns, and the huts were surrounded as
quickly as possible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Russell, you will take the trail to the
left,&rdquo; said an orderly, dashing up. &ldquo;Major Morris
will rejoin you at the fork in the road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The trail to the left,&rdquo; repeated Ben, and
turned to his company. &ldquo;Forward, boys,&mdash;left
oblique!&rdquo; he shouted, and on they went again,
past the nipa huts and down a trail leading along
the edge of a rich plantation. Several more huts
were passed, but the inmates were nothing but
women and children, and offered no resistance.
Then at a distance could be seen a stone wall, as
if the insurgents had endeavored to construct a
rude fortification in a great hurry.</p>
<p>The company was going at the stone wall pell-mell
when Ben called a sudden halt. &ldquo;To the
right, boys, and come at the end of the wall,&rdquo;
were his orders, and the command swept around
as desired.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span></div>
<p>Bang! The report was hardly expected, and
with it half a dozen of the stones composing the
rude fortification gave way, disclosing a cannon
made of a bored-out tree-trunk, wound round and
round with telegraph wire stolen from the lines
along the railroad. This wooden cannon had been
heavily charged with cartridges, old nails, and
bits of iron, and the first discharge rent the mouth
into a dozen pieces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was a narrow shave!&rdquo; cried Gilmore, as
he and Ben looked around, to find all the company
unharmed. &ldquo;Who ever supposed the rascals
would put up such a job as that on us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll do anything,&rdquo; replied the young captain.
&ldquo;But that isn&rsquo;t a new idea. Wooden cannons
were used in the Civil War, so I&rsquo;ve been
told.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the discharge of the wooden gun, the
rebels concealed behind the stone fortification had
fled. The Americans now made after them, more
&ldquo;hot-footed&rdquo; than ever, and the incessant crack
of firearms was followed by many a groan and
yell of pain as over a dozen Filipinos went down,
three to their death.</p>
<p>At the fork mentioned by Major Morris, Ben
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
brought his company to a halt. All were panting
for breath, for the brush at close quarters had put
them on their mettle. The rest of the battalion
soon came up, and the other battalions followed,
from another road, and then the regiment, with
the other troops, pushed on into Angat.</p>
<p>Much to the astonishment of all, the beautiful
town, with its century-old churches and quaint government
buildings, was found practically deserted.
The only inhabitants left were a few women and
a handful of aged men, all of whom said they
would do anything for the <i>Americanos</i> if they were
spared their lives. These frightened people were
soon put at ease, and then an inspection of the
captured place was instituted.</p>
<p>In various places, such as the vaults of convents
and government buildings, huge quantities of
<i>pilai</i>, that is, unhulled rice, were found. Some
of the rice was confiscated for army use, and a
large quantity was distributed to the natives who
gradually drifted in, saying they wanted to be
friendly, and that they were starving.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be that the rice we give away may go
to the rebels,&rdquo; said the general in command. &ldquo;But
we can&rsquo;t let these poor wretches starve, war or no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
war;&rdquo; and so the bags were given out until very
little remained.</p>
<p>It was not General Lawton&rsquo;s intention to quarter
at Angat for any length of time, and, having
entered the town in the morning, he left it in the
afternoon, to begin an advance up the river the
next day, striking San Rafael on the right bank
and Muronco on the left bank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody has set Angat on fire!&rdquo; exclaimed
Ben, as the regiment marched away. A thick
column of smoke had suddenly risen from the
upper end of the town.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it was our men,&rdquo; answered
Major Morris, who walked beside the young captain.
&ldquo;They had strict orders not to loot or
burn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The flames speedily increased, as one nipa hut
after another caught, and the warehouses added to
the blaze. The Americans always thought the
rebels started this conflagration, while the insurgents
laid the crime at our door. However it
was, Angat burned fiercely, and by nightfall little
remained of its many picturesque buildings.</p>
<p>The weather was beginning to tell upon the
troops, and out of Ben&rsquo;s regiment fully forty men
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
were on the sick list, with either colds or tropical
fever, and these had to be sent back to a sick
camp. The balance of the command, it was decided,
should join the troops that were to attack
San Rafael.</p>
<p>As before, the sharpshooters were in front, while
the infantry were escorted by Scott&rsquo;s battery, who,
as soon as the enemy&rsquo;s firing line was located,
began to pour in a hot fire of shrapnel, much to
the latter&rsquo;s discomfiture. Then Ben&rsquo;s regiment
went into action once more, the young captain&rsquo;s
company on the edge of some heavy brush.</p>
<p>The sharp clip, clip of Mauser bullets made unpleasant
music as the soldier boys rushed through the
thickets, to surprise not a few Filipinos who were
in hiding, and who imagined that the Americans
would pass them by unnoticed. Once Ben came
upon a man lying on his face in a mass of tall
grass, every part of his body concealed but his
back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can he be dead?&rdquo; thought the young captain,
when of a sudden the native leaped up like lightning
and darted behind the nearest bushes before
anybody could stop him. Half a dozen soldiers
fired on him, and he fired in return, but none of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
the shots took effect; and Ben could not but
think that the poor creature had earned his escape.
&ldquo;For ten chances to one he doesn&rsquo;t know
what he is fighting about,&rdquo; he said to Gilmore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right you are,&rdquo; answered the lieutenant. &ldquo;I
believe if we could corral the whole crowd and
explain the true situation to them, they would
throw down their arms without hesitation. It is
only the leaders who are keeping this rebellion
alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Over near the battery just mentioned stood General
Lawton, tall and erect, directing every movement,
without a single thought of personal danger.
Many a shot was directed at him, but he seemed
to bear a charmed life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;San Rafael will soon be ours,&rdquo; said one of the
officers of the staff. &ldquo;See, the enemy are retreating!&rdquo;
he cried enthusiastically.</p>
<p>At that moment an orderly dashed up, carrying
an order from General Otis. The order read that
the column must rest at Angat until supplies could
be forwarded from Malolos. A shadow fell over
the commando&rsquo;s face. Another victory was at
hand&mdash;but orders were orders, and must be obeyed.
Slowly the retreat was sounded, and the insurgents
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
were left in possession of the field. They thought
the Americans were being forced back on account
of a heavy loss, and went almost wild with delight,
proclaiming the encounter a great victory for the
Filipino cause.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>THE CROSSING OF THE RIO GRANDE RIVER</h3>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;For gracious&rsquo; sake, what did we want to retreat
for?&rdquo; demanded Ben, as soon as the command
halted and Major Morris had come within speaking
distance. The young captain had been at the
very front of the firing line, and had seen that
complete victory was only the work of a quarter
of an hour or less.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Orders from general headquarters,&rdquo; replied the
major, in a low tone. &ldquo;I fancy the staff is pretty
angry, too,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We could have whipped them with ease.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So we could, captain, but&mdash;&rdquo; And Major
Morris finished with a shrug of his shoulders
which meant a good deal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe General Otis would have given
such an order had he been here to see what was
going on,&rdquo; continued Ben, earnestly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;re ordered back to Angat, and that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
is all there is to it. The army must have supplies,
you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hang the supplies!&rdquo; muttered Gilmore, but
under his breath. &ldquo;We can get all the supplies
we want as we go along.&rdquo; And Ben was rather
inclined to agree with him.</p>
<p>There was no help, however, for the turn in
the situation; and with crestfallen faces the soldiers
moved still further back and went into temporary
camp. Only a few had suffered, and the wounded
ones were promptly cared for by the hospital corps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how do you feel?&rdquo; asked Gilbert, as he
came up to see Ben. &ldquo;Does the wound hurt still?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It itches, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; answered Ben. &ldquo;But this
retreat&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Makes one feel sore all over, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; finished
the young Southerner. &ldquo;I must say I don&rsquo;t
understand it at all. If we are going to round up
any of these rebels, we can&rsquo;t do it by falling back
and waiting for supplies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Impatient as they were, however, the troops had
to wait for two days before another movement
was made. During this time supplies were hurried
forward in large quantities, that there might be
no more delays in the future.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span></div>
<p>In the meantime the troops under General MacArthur
were by no means idle. They consisted
of two brigades, that of General Hale on the right
wing, and that of General Wheaton on the left
wing. Of these troops the first advance was by
some men of the Fourth Cavalry, who went forward
to reconnoitre the enemy&rsquo;s position near
Quingua. The start was made during the early
morning, and before long the insurgents opened a
heavy fire which the Americans returned with difficulty,
as the rebels were well concealed by the
tall grass and their intrenchments. To aid the
cavalry a number of other troops were hurried
forward, also several field-pieces; and in the end
the Filipinos were forced from their position, with
a heavy loss. In this battle the Americans lost
six killed and forty wounded. Among the killed
was Colonel Stotsenburg, commanding the First
Nebraska Volunteers, who, after most gallantly
leading his men, was shot down in the final rush
upon the enemy&rsquo;s earthworks.</p>
<p>From Quingua the whole of General Hale&rsquo;s brigade
moved down the Quingua River to Pulilan.
Here no resistance was encountered, and after a
brief rest the brigade pushed on toward Logundi.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
That town was not yet reached when the advance
guard reported a breastwork across the main road,
running to the river on the west and into the jungle
on the east.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, we&rsquo;ll go ahead anyhow!&rdquo; shouted
the soldiers of the Nebraska regiment; and go ahead
they did, with the South Dakota and Iowa troops
beside them, and several guns of the Sixth Artillery
protecting their advance. The fight at the earthworks
was a fierce one, some of the Filipinos refusing
to surrender even when they knew they were
beaten; and as a consequence many of them were
slain whose lives might otherwise have been spared
to them.</p>
<p>A short distance to the northwest of Logundi, the
Quingua and the Bagbag rivers join in flowing into
the Calumpit. The railroad crosses the Bagbag but
a short distance away, and at this point General
Hale&rsquo;s command reunited with that of General
Wheaton, which had come up along the tracks from
Malolos without difficulty. General Wheaton had
with him the troops from Montana and Kansas,
some Utah artillery, and one or two other commands,
along with two armored cars, fitted out with
Gatling and Hotchkiss guns and six-pounders.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span></div>
<p>It was soon discovered that the rebels had built
strong breastworks in a semicircle along the north
bank of the Bagbag and the western bank of the
Calumpit Rivers, and had injured the railroad track
for a distance of several hundred yards, and also the
bridge spanning the river. As the approach to both
rivers was largely an open one, how to dislodge the
Filipinos became a serious problem.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forward with the armored cars!&rdquo; was the cry,
and they were rushed ahead as far as the torn-up
condition of the railroad tracks admitted. A cannonading
lasting for half an hour followed, in which
one of the batteries on the highway also took part.
The aim of the gunners was good, and soon the
insurgents were seen to be pouring from the
trenches, which were getting too hot to hold them.
Yet a fair number held their ground, and when the
troops on foot advanced they opened a blistering
fire which laid not a few Americans low. But the
victory was ours, and soon the followers of Old
Glory were wading or swimming the river, while
the engineering corps set to work to repair the
damage done to railroad and bridge, so that the
armored and baggage cars might pass through.</p>
<p>The cry was now, &ldquo;On to Calumpit!&rdquo; which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
town lies on the Calumpit River, and is divided into
two parts by another stream, called the Rio Grande.
It was found that the insurgents had practically
deserted the lower half of the town, but had intrenchments
on the upper bank of the Rio Grande
which were even more formidable than those taken
on the Bagbag. Here the rebels had also a Maxim
and other guns, and it seemed as if for once the
advance of the Americans was thoroughly blocked.
Numerous good positions along the south bank of
the river were held by our troops, but it looked as
if they could not get over the stream without a
tremendous loss of life.</p>
<p>It is said that the opportunity makes the man,
and in this instance the saying proved a true one.
With the soldiers under General Wheaton were the
Twentieth Kansas Volunteers, who had already
made a record for themselves at Malolos and elsewhere,
as related in a previous volume of this
series. They were commanded by Colonel Frederick
Funston, a man comparatively young in years
and small in stature, but one who was daring to the
last degree, and who had seen much of fighting and
hardships during his adventurous existence. In
Cuba, Funston had fought most valiantly under
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
Garcia for Cuban liberty long before any interference
by the United States.</p>
<p>To Colonel, afterward Brigadier General, Funston
belongs the honor of the passage of the Rio Grande,
for it was he who planned what was done, and he
and a score of his fighting Kansans who carried it
out. The daring of the scheme is one which will
live long in American history.</p>
<p>As before mentioned, the bridge was partly
broken, but enough remained for the passage of soldiers
who could climb from one iron cross-section to
another. At first it was hoped that a body might
go over the bridge in the dark, raise a great commotion,
and cause the Filipinos a panic. This scheme
was tried, but it failed; for the enemy was on strict
guard, and would have shot down the men as rapidly
as they appeared on the bridge.</p>
<p>Colonel Funston then proposed to go down the
river bank for a considerable distance, build rafts,
and, by means of a stout rope, ferry some of the best
of his men across the stream in the dark. The
landing of the men was to be covered by the heaviest
possible fire from the American side, and, as soon
as they were safe ashore, the Kansas soldiers were to
secure some position where they might enfilade the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
enemy&rsquo;s trenches, that is, fire through them from
one end, so that the Filipinos might no longer find
them safe. In the meantime more troops were to
come over with all possible speed.</p>
<p>On the way down the stream the Kansas soldiers
demolished several huts, selecting the best of the
timber with which to build their rafts. The moon
was under a cloud, and it looked as if they might
get across the river without serious trouble.</p>
<p>But as the crowd were constructing their rafts
and getting their ferry rope ready for use, the moon
came out brightly; and very soon the insurgents
became suspicious and fired on the Americans, who
were forced to retreat to the nearest shelter. The
firing kept up the greater part of two hours, and at
last the plan to cross over that night was abandoned.</p>
<p>But the Kansas colonel and his gallant men had
determined to be the first into the enemy&rsquo;s camp,
and once again they went to the spot previously
selected, but this time in the broad daylight, when
they might clearly see the shore opposite. No
insurgents were in sight; and, after having made
three rafts all right and tight, the rope was brought
forth, and two men, named White and Trembly,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
were asked to carry it across the stream. The soldiers
plunged into the water without delay, being
watched by hundreds of their comrades left behind.
The men were without their uniforms or weapons of
any kind.</p>
<p>Slowly the pair swam the turbulent waters of the
stream, and hardly had they gotten fifty feet from
shore when the rebels opened fire upon them, at first
a few scattering shots and then a perfect volley.
That the swimmers escaped is little short of a miracle.
But they remained untouched, and, gaining the
opposite bank, they ran forward and tied the rope&rsquo;s
end to a tree-stump. In the meantime two other
soldiers started over the Rio Grande in a dugout,
but this upset and let the men into the water, and
they had to swim as had the others. But they
landed with their guns intact, and at once opened
fire at the nearest natives that showed themselves.</p>
<p>All this had happened with great rapidity, and now
the first raft was coming across the river, loaded
with Kansas soldiers officered by Colonel Funston
himself. The raft became the target for the hottest
kind of fire, and as the ferrying had to be done by
the soldiers pulling along the rope stretched from
shore to shore, the passage was as slow as it was dangerous.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
But the soldiers on the craft went over in
safety, and soon more followed, until over fifty were
on the beach fronting the enemy&rsquo;s intrenchments.
Then, with a wild yelling, to give the rebels the
impression that a large body had come over, they
pushed forward to enfilade the enemy&rsquo;s trenches as
first proposed.</p>
<p>But now another difficulty arose. There was a
small stream flowing into the Rio Grande near this
spot, and this had to be crossed before the fire of
the Americans could be made effective. How to
get across was a problem, as the insurgents had a
machine gun trained on the spot. This worked for
a while and then stopped; and in the lull Colonel
Funston secured a rowboat and went over with some
of his men, and the others soon followed.</p>
<p>The Filipinos were now thoroughly frightened, for
the Americans were making a great outcry down by
the railroad bridge, and they imagined that they were
to be attacked from several points at once. Some
started to run, and as soon as Colonel Funston&rsquo;s men
began to rain their bullets into the long trenches,
more followed, until the enemy was in a panic.
Then the Americans began to cross the bridge and
stream in great numbers, and the Filipinos, although
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
re&euml;nforced by a body of Macabebes just at this
time, could not make an effective stand. Calumpit
was left behind, and a running fight ensued which
ended at Apalit, when a violent tropical thunderstorm
put an end to the day&rsquo;s operations. It was
thought that the rebels&rsquo; headquarters would be found
at Apalit; but this had, at the last moment, been
removed to San Isidro, toward which General Lawton
was now advancing.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>SOMETHING ABOUT A POISONED WELL</h3>
</div>
<p>After the rest at Angat, the taking of San Rafael
by General Lawton&rsquo;s troops was an easy matter, and
on May 1&mdash;the anniversary of Admiral Dewey&rsquo;s
great victory in Manila Bay&mdash;the soldiers set out for
the town of Baliuag, five miles to the northward.</p>
<p>In spite of the recent rain, the road was hard and
even dusty in spots. The heat was still as great as
ever, and Ben was glad to take the benefit of any
shade that afforded itself as he marched along at the
head of his command. The date made him think
of the battle just mentioned, and this brought him
around to Larry once more, and he began to wonder
if his brother would ever turn up again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose I&rsquo;ll have to write to Walter and to
Uncle Job about this,&rdquo; he muttered dismally. &ldquo;But
I hate to do it, especially if Larry does turn up, for
I know it will worry both of them greatly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The road was thick with palms and plantains and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
trailing plants, the latter of gorgeous colorings.
Nipa huts and bamboo cottages were numerous, but
the inmates kept themselves well hidden as the little
army passed by. In the distance were paddy-fields
and cane-brakes, and along the road were numerous
mud-holes, some of which had to be bridged over
before the artillery could pass in safety. More than
once horses and cannon got stuck, and many a shoulder
had to be put to the pieces to budge them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If there was no war, this would be a delightful
spot in which to spend a vacation,&rdquo; remarked Gilbert,
who had come up for a little talk, as was his habit
when they were pushing ahead in irregular formation.
&ldquo;I reckon the natives take solid comfort in
their homes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose it puts you in mind of the South at
home,&rdquo; returned Ben, with a smile, &ldquo;It is nice, certainly.
But I fancy this continual heat would make
one mighty lazy in time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the natives are lazy, you can easily see
that,&rdquo; laughed the young Southerner. &ldquo;I wish I
could get a good drink of water,&rdquo; he added, a minute
later.</p>
<p>They soon came to a pretty dwelling, set in a perfect
wilderness of flowers and shrubs. Toward the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
side they made out a well, and ran forward to fill
their canteens.</p>
<p>The pair were at the well when a shrill cry from one
of the side rooms of the house attracted their attention.
Looking up, they saw a native girl waving
her hand frantically at them. The girl was nicely
dressed and evidently belonged to the better classes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We only want a drink!&rdquo; shouted Ben, thinking
that the maiden might imagine they had come into
the garden to steal.</p>
<p>But the girl shouted more loudly than ever, and
waved them away from the well. &ldquo;Bad! bad!&rdquo;
she cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, we are not so bad as you think,&rdquo; Gilbert
shouted back; and was about to take a drink from a
cocoanut-shell dipper which hung handy, when the
girl came out of the cottage on a run and dashed the
dipper to the ground. At the same time an evil-looking
Filipino appeared at the doorway, shook his
fist at the girl, and then suddenly ran for the barns
behind the dwelling and disappeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want a drink and I&rsquo;m going to have it,&rdquo; began
Gilbert, sternly, for he did not like the manner in
which the water had been spilt over his clothing.
&ldquo;If you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;The well is poisoned; don&rsquo;t drink, it will kill
you!&rdquo; gasped the girl, in Spanish.</p>

&ldquo;The well is poisoned! don&rsquo;t drink! it will kill you!&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Page 115.</i><br />
</p>
</div>
<p>As old readers know, Gilbert understood a little
of the language, having picked it up while on a trip
to Cuba, and also while serving as a Rough Rider in
that island. He started back and caught the maiden
by the arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poisoned! you are certain?&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, se&ntilde;or; my uncle put the poison in only
yesterday. He lost much at Angat, and he is very
angry at the <i>Americanos</i> in consequence. He knew
the soldiers were coming this way, and he wanted to
poison as many as he could. He put a water-barrel
down on the road full of the poisoned water, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is your uncle, the man who just ran off?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, se&ntilde;or. But, oh, do not go after him, I pray
you!&rdquo; cried the girl, in high alarm. &ldquo;I would not
have spoken, but I could not see you poisoned before
my very eyes; no, not that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As quickly as he could, Gilbert translated her
words to Ben, who listened in amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The villain!&rdquo; ejaculated the young captain.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard of this sort of thing being done before.
I wonder where that barrel is that she spoke about?
We must find it and empty it of its contents.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span></div>
<p>Gilbert put the question to the girl, who announced
that the barrel was on another road back of the
plantation. Whether any of the soldiers had reached
it or not was a question.</p>
<p>As quickly as he could Ben reported the situation
to his superior, and received orders to divide his
company, leaving a part to guard the poisoned well
so that no Americans might drink from it, while the
rest should go and hunt up the water-barrel. Gilbert
was detailed to accompany Ben, and the girl
was given to understand that she must take the
soldiers to where the barrel had been set up.</p>
<p>At first the maiden demurred; but there was no
help for it, and the kind smiles which Gilbert and
Ben gave her were an assurance that no harm was
about to befall her. Yet she was afraid that when
the reckoning came her uncle would deal harshly
with her, and trembled violently as she moved
through the rice-fields with the two young officers
beside her.</p>
<p>The little command had nearly reached the back
road when the report of a gun rang out, coming
from the direction of a wood behind the rice-fields.
The bullet sped past Ben&rsquo;s shoulder, to bury itself in
the fleshy part of one of his private&rsquo;s arms.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis my uncle!&rdquo; cried the girl. &ldquo;Oh, he will
kill us all, I am sure of it!&rdquo; And she became so
agitated that she sank down and could not go
another step.</p>
<p>Without hesitation, Ben ordered his men forward
on the run, and away went the detachment for the
spot from whence the unexpected shot had come.
As the soldiers neared the wood they beheld a Filipino
in the act of running across a small opening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s him, the rascal!&rdquo; roared Dan Casey, and
taking a hasty aim he fired, and the rebel was seen
to plunge forward on his face. When the party
came up they found that the man had been hit in
the hip, and that the wound, while not necessarily
dangerous, was serious, and would put the fellow out
of the contest for several months.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It serves him right,&rdquo; said Ben. &ldquo;Poisoning
drinking water is not fair fighting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl soon came up, crying bitterly. She
wished to remain by her uncle, but Ben made her
understand that she must point out the water-barrel
first, and after that he would have two soldiers
remove the wounded man to the cottage.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later the rear road was gained, and
here the water-barrel was found, set up on end, with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
the top knocked out. It was three-quarters full of
water, and a dozen or more soldiers were drinking
and filling their canteens.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop drinking!&rdquo; ordered Ben, when still at a
distance. &ldquo;That water has been doctored and will
make you sick.&rdquo; He refrained from saying the
water was poisoned for fear of creating a panic.</p>
<p>The water was at once poured out on the ground
and the barrel smashed up. Then a surgeon was
found, to whom Ben related the facts of the case.
A canteen of the water was examined, and the
surgeon decided to give the man who had drunk
the stuff an emetic. A few of the soldiers were
taken with cramps inside of an hour afterward, and
two of them were seriously sick for a week; but no
lives were lost. But if the soldiers could have got
at the Filipino who had poisoned the water, they
would have shot him on the spot.</p>
<p>As soon as the danger was over, Ben returned to
the wood, and had two men carry the wounded man
back to the cottage, where he was left in charge of his
wife and his niece. Through Gilbert it was learned
that the wife had also remonstrated against using
the poison, so it was fair to suppose that the aunt
would protect her niece to a certain degree. &ldquo;But
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
she&rsquo;ll have a hard time of it for doing us a service,
I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; said the young Southerner, as he and
Ben resumed the march.</p>
<p>The scouts, under Chief Young, were in advance,
and now a steady firing from the front told that
another battle was at hand. Soon General Lawton
came dashing through the crowd on the road, followed
by his staff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forward, boys!&rdquo; was the cry, and then Ben&rsquo;s
command left the road and took to the rice-fields on
the outskirts of Baliuag. The line was a long one,
with the Oregon and Minnesota soldiers forming the
skirmishing end, and Scott&rsquo;s battery in a paddy-field
on the extreme right. So far the insurgents had
kept well hidden; but as the Americans drew closer
to the town they could be seen running in half a
dozen directions, as if undecided whether to fight or
to flee.</p>
<p>The townspeople themselves were in a panic, and
down the streets ran Filipinos and Chinese, some with
their household effects piled high on their backs.
They had heard of the coming of the <i>Americanos</i>,
but had hoped almost against hope that their beloved
town would be passed by unmolested.</p>
<p>Ben&rsquo;s regiment was moving along rapidly when
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
they came to a ditch which seemed to divide the
rice-field in half. A short pause followed, when
along came the cry of &ldquo;Down!&rdquo; and every man
dropped, and none too soon, for the insurgents
had opened up unexpectedly from a cane-brake
behind the rice-field.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must take that cane-brake,&rdquo; came the order
from the colonel, and the word was passed along
quickly, and away went the companies with a
ringing cheer, firing as they ran, and reloading
with all possible speed.</p>
<p>Ben was now truly in his element, and, waving
his sword, he urged Company D well to the front,
so that the cane was soon reached. But the rebels
were not game for a hand-to-hand encounter and
fled once more, through the cane and over a field
of heavy grass leading to the very outskirts of the
town beyond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are running away!&rdquo; was the cry. &ldquo;On
we go, boys, and the town will be ours in less
than half an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But now a halt was ordered, on the edge of the
cane-brake. From the outskirts of the town appeared
a Filipino waving a white rag over his
head.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Flag of truce!&rdquo; cried the American general.
&ldquo;Cease firing!&rdquo; And the order was instantly
obeyed. &ldquo;Major Morris, you can select a detail
of three men and find out what they want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will, general,&rdquo; answered the major of the
first battalion, and saluted. He had soon chosen
his men, one of whom was Gilbert Pennington,
and, waving a white flag before them, the party of
four advanced into the open field.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>IN WHICH A FLAG OF TRUCE IS FIRED UPON</h3>
</div>
<p>Major Morris well knew the wiliness of the
Filipinos, yet he did not doubt but that they
would pay due respect to a flag of truce which
they had themselves invited. Accordingly he advanced
boldly with his little party, until the four
had covered fully one-half of the distance which
separated the American troops from the point
where the rebels had taken a stand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is thrustin&rsquo; thim a whole lot!&rdquo; groaned
Dan Casey, who was the closest man in the ranks
to Ben. &ldquo;If he gits plugged&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They won&rsquo;t dare to fire, Dan,&rdquo; said a companion.
&ldquo;If they did&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The speech was cut short by the pop of a
Mauser rifle, followed by two more pops, and the
private who carried the white flag was seen to
fling the banner down and fall headlong. In the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
meantime, the Filipinos who had appeared with
the white rag were running back to their own
ranks with all possible speed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have fired on the flag of truce!&rdquo; The
cry arose from a hundred throats, and then a
scattering volley rang out. At the same time the
Filipinos opened up in a body, and Major Morris,
Gilbert, and the third man were seen to pitch
into the tall grass in such a manner that they
were almost hidden from view.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gilbert is shot! And Major Morris too!&rdquo;
Such was the painful thought which ran through
Ben&rsquo;s brain. He looked at the colonel pleadingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Advance at once, Captain Russell, with the
first battalion, to the rescue of the flag of truce,&rdquo;
ordered the colonel, understanding him fully.
&ldquo;After this, give the enemy no quarter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forward, men, to the rescue!&rdquo; shouted the
young captain, almost before his superior had finished.
&ldquo;Deploy to the left and fire at will. And
make every shot tell!&rdquo; he added bitterly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forward it is!&rdquo; shouted Dan Casey. &ldquo;Down
wid the haythins that don&rsquo;t know the manin&rsquo; av
honor!&rdquo; And he led in the rush over the long
grass.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span></div>
<p>The whole line was soon advancing, but Ben&rsquo;s
company was in front, and kept there until within
a hundred feet of where the four men had gone
down. Then, to his amazement, the young captain
saw Major Morris leap up, followed by Gilbert
and the third soldier, and run with all speed
toward the American line.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not shot!&rdquo; cried Ben, joyfully. &ldquo;Heaven be
thanked for that!&rdquo; And he almost felt like
embracing his two friends. Only the flag-bearer
had been struck, and he not seriously. The others
had gone down in the long grass to destroy the
enemy&rsquo;s aim. The wounded flag-carrier was taken
to the rear, and then the whole line pushed on
with a yell which was as savage as it was loud
and long. The incident, short as it was, was not
forgotten, and when one end of the American line
closed in on the retreating insurgents the latter
fought to the last, knowing only too well that
little quarter would be given to them because of
their perfidy.</p>
<p>The long American line had swung toward Baliuag
in a semicircle, and now, when the insurgents tried
to flee by way of the north, they found themselves
confronted front and rear. This put them in more
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
of a panic than ever; and had General Lawton had a
thousand additional troops, it is more than likely he
could have surrounded the rebels completely and
compelled every one in that territory to throw down
his arms.</p>
<p>But he had not the extra men, nor could he get
them. Moreover, he had hardly a decent map of
the territory, while the enemy knew every field,
every road, and every stream. They could not
make a stand at Baliuag, nor could they run in the
direction of San Rafael, so their only course was to
take to the rice-fields, the cane-brakes, and the jungle,
and this they did in short order.</p>
<p>By the time the outskirts of the town was gained
Ben&rsquo;s command was almost exhausted; yet the
colonel of the regiment felt that now was no time
to rest, and company after company was sent out
in the hope that some of the scattering bands of
insurgents might be rounded up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Major Morris, you will take your four companies
up yonder road,&rdquo; said the colonel, after receiving
orders from General Lawton&rsquo;s orderly, and the head
of the regiment pointed out the road in question.
Soon the battalion was off on the double-quick, the
major more than eager to wipe out the treachery
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
which had been shown to him and his companions
but an hour or two before.</p>
<p>The road which the battalion followed was a winding
one, lined with cottages of the better sort, showing
that this was a fashionable outskirt of the town.
Only a few people showed themselves, and nothing
was seen or heard of the insurgents until a quarter
of a mile had been covered, and the best of the
habitations had been left behind. Then came an
unexpected fire from a cane-brake, and out dashed
fully two hundred savage-looking Tagals armed with
guns and bolos.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Halt! Fire!&rdquo; came the commands, and the
Americans obeyed as quickly as possible. Several
of our men had been hit, one seriously, and now half
a dozen Filipinos went down. For several minutes
the fighting was at close quarters, and it looked as if
the battalion had run into an ambush and were about
to be slaughtered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the shelter of the trees!&rdquo; shouted Ben, and
was about to guide his men when a fierce-looking
rebel officer leaped before him with drawn sword.
His own blade met that of the enemy, and both
flashed fire. But the Tagal was a fine swordsman
and kept at his work, feeling certain that he could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
run the <i>Americano</i> through and through. Clack!
clack! went the blades, up and down, side to side,
and straight forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take care there!&rdquo; came from Major Morris, and
just then the Tagal&rsquo;s sword pricked Ben&rsquo;s arm.
The young captain leaped back a step, then came
forward, and as quick as lightning his sword found
the Tagal&rsquo;s ribs. At the same time Dan Casey fired
at the enemy, and the officer went down flat on his
back, shot through the breast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had to do it,&rdquo; cried the Irish volunteer. &ldquo;I
thought he was afther stickin&rsquo; ye like a pig!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a close shave,&rdquo; murmured Ben, as he
passed on. &ldquo;He handled his sword like an expert.
I shan&rsquo;t forget you for that, Casey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, an&rsquo; that&rsquo;s all right, captain,&rdquo; answered the
soldier, quickly. &ldquo;Is your arm hurted much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess not. Come, we&rsquo;ve got them on the run
again.&rdquo; And away the pair went, into the cane-brake,
through which the rebels were crashing like
so many wild cattle.</p>
<p>The day had been full of excitement, but much
more was to follow. The cane-brakes were heavy,
and soon Ben and Casey found themselves separated
from the main body of the battalion and out of sight
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
of their own company. Then several Filipinos
confronted them and called upon them to surrender.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ain&rsquo;t surrenderin&rsquo; just yit, we ain&rsquo;t!&rdquo; howled
the Irish soldier, and let drive at the nearest rebel,
while Ben discharged his pistol. Two of the enemy
were wounded, and in an instant the others took to
their heels, evidently convinced that such fighters
were &ldquo;too many&rdquo; for them.</p>
<p>The encounter, however, had taken time, and now
Ben called upon his companion to stop running.
&ldquo;We want to know where we are running to first,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;Listen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They listened and made out a distant firing to
both the right and the left. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afther thinkin&rsquo;
our b&rsquo;ys is to the right,&rdquo; said Dan Casey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you are right, Casey; although both
of us may be mistaken,&rdquo; rejoined the young captain
of Company D. &ldquo;We will try that direction,
anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They continued on their way through the cane-brake
until they reached a small stream. Here the
ground was soft and full of treacherous bog-holes,
and both looked at each other in dismay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, an&rsquo; this is more than we bargained fer, eh,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
captain?&rdquo; remarked Casey, as he pulled himself out
of a hole into which he had gone almost to his knees.
&ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t look out we&rsquo;ll git stuck so tight
there&rsquo;ll be no budgin&rsquo; av us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ground to the right seems to be firmer,&rdquo;
replied Ben. &ldquo;Come, we will move in that direction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But to get out of the soft spot was not easy, and
soon they found themselves between the tall cane
and up to their knees in a muck that seemed to stick
worse than glue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, an&rsquo; this is fightin&rsquo; wid a vengeance,&rdquo; said
the Irish volunteer, smiling grimly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s sthuck
we are like flies on a fly paper, eh, Captain
Russell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to get out somehow, Casey,&rdquo; answered
Ben, half desperately. &ldquo;Our command is
marching farther and farther away, and we&rsquo;ll have
all we can do to get up to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure thin, an&rsquo; Major Morris betther send a
detail back wid a long rope to pull us out. We
couldn&rsquo;t fly from the inimy now if we thried, could
we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is no joke, Casey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joke, bedad? No, captain, I&rsquo;m afther thinkin&rsquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
it&rsquo;s a mighty sarious difficulty. But there&rsquo;s no use
av cryin&rsquo;, no matther how bad it is,&rdquo; finished the
Irish soldier, philosophically.</p>
<p>A moment of reflection convinced Ben that the
best thing he could do was to go back part of the
distance they had come, and make an endeavor to
cross the little stream at another point.</p>
<p>They retreated with difficulty, first one sinking
into some treacherous hole and then the other.
Once Casey went flat on his back, and gave a loud
yell of dismay when he found himself covered with
a mud that was more like a paste than anything
else.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll not go in such a cane-field again,
bedad,&rdquo; he muttered, as he started to pick up the
gun he had dropped. As he did so a cracking of
cane-stalks near them caused both to straighten up
in alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who comes?&rdquo; cried Ben, and drew the pistol he
had shoved into his belt.</p>
<p>There was no answer and he repeated the demand.
&ldquo;Are you Americans?&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>Still there was no reply. But the cracking of the
stalks continued, and the sounds seemed to move
around the pair in something of a circle. Then
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
came a soft command in the Tagalog dialect. At
once Dan Casey clutched Ben by the arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They be afther surroundin&rsquo; us, captain,&rdquo; he
whispered. &ldquo;Be the noises there must be tin or
a dozen av thim. Phwat shall we do, fight or run
fer it?&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>SURROUNDED BY THE ENEMY</h3>
</div>
<p>For the moment after Dan Casey spoke Ben was
silent, not knowing himself what was best to do.
That the Filipinos were surrounding them there
could be no doubt, since those approaching would
have answered the young captain of Company D
had they been Americans.</p>
<p>The position of the pair was dangerous in the
extreme, for the tall cane-stalks surrounded them
upon all sides, giving shelter to the enemy, while the
Tagals could see the volunteers with ease.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep quiet, Casey,&rdquo; whispered Ben, as the soldier
started to speak again. &ldquo;They may not know
how many there are of us here and sneak off, fearing
an ambush.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Irish volunteer nodded to show that he
understood. He was holding his gun before him,
ready to shoot whenever it appeared necessary.</p>
<p>Presently there was another whispered command,
coming from directly in front of our friends. A
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
slight movement in the cane-brake followed, and then
all became silent once more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come!&rdquo; whispered Ben. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fire until you
see me do so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus speaking, the young captain moved slowly
and cautiously from the spot they had occupied for
five minutes or more. He picked his steps, and
they fell as silently as those of a cat after a bird.
Casey was at his heels, almost holding his breath,
and his small eyes glistening with expectancy.
Both knew that they were carrying their lives in
their hands.</p>
<p>Two rods had been covered, and still nothing was
seen of the Filipinos. Was it possible that they had
withdrawn? But no, there was another cracking of
cane-stalks and another command in the Tagalog
language, coming now from their left. Then of a
sudden a Mauser rang out, and a bullet whistled
back of Ben&rsquo;s head and across Casey&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>The report had not yet died out when Ben fired,
straight for the flash of fire of which he had caught
a momentary glimpse. That his shot reached its
mark was proven by the wild yell of pain which
followed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The jig is up!&rdquo; cried Dan Casey. &ldquo;We must
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
run fer it, captain!&rdquo; And as a Tagal came into
view before them he fired point-blank at the fellow,
hitting him in the breast and killing him on the spot.</p>
<p>As luck would have it, the Filipino whom Casey
had killed was a petty officer and the leader of the
detachment, and his sudden taking-off disconcerted
the insurgents for a minute, who yelled one to
another that their leader was shot. Taking advantage
of the confusion, our friends rushed headlong
through the cane-brake, firing several times as they
ran. A dozen shots answered them, but none of
these took effect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think the road is yonder,&rdquo; said Ben, pointing
with his pistol as they progressed. &ldquo;Hark!&rdquo;</p>
<p>From a distance came a scattering volley, proving
that the fighting was not yet over. It came
from the direction in which they were running.
But now those left behind were after them, shooting
and shouting with vigor, for they were ten to two,
and were determined that the wicked <i>Americanos</i>
should not escape their clutches.</p>
<p>At last the cane-brake was left behind. Beyond
was a small part of a rice-field, and close by a
cottage which appeared deserted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, captain, an&rsquo; we&rsquo;ll be shot down like dogs
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
if we show ourselves in th&rsquo; open,&rdquo; panted Casey,
who was almost out of breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get behind the house,&rdquo; answered Ben. &ldquo;It
is our one chance,&rdquo; and he started in advance.
Again the Filipinos fired on them, and this time
a bullet touched the young captain&rsquo;s side, cutting
a straight hole through his clothing.</p>
<p>They were yet a hundred feet from the cottage
when two American soldiers came rushing forth,
guns in hand. The strangers took in the situation
at a glance, and let drive with such good aim that
two of the enemy fell back wounded. The others
paused, not knowing how many Americans might
be concealed in the building, and in another minute
Ben and Casey were for the time being safe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By gum, ef it ain&rsquo;t Captain Russell!&rdquo; cried
one of the soldiers, as he faced Ben. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m right
glad to be yere to help ye, cap&rsquo;n,&rdquo; and he smiled
broadly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ralph Sorrel!&rdquo; returned Ben, as he recognized
the tall Tennesseean who had once accompanied him
on a search for Gilbert when the young Southerner
was missing. &ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jeming an&rsquo; me hev got a wounded man with
us&mdash;Sergeant Kaser o&rsquo; our company. We war
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
takin&rsquo; him back o&rsquo; the lines, when he got so bad
we brung him in yere to rest a spell. But you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thim rebels is comin&rsquo; agin!&rdquo; announced Dan
Casey. &ldquo;Six, eight, nine av thim, wid wan limpin&rsquo;.
How many av us are there here?&rdquo; he asked, as
he looked around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four,&rdquo; answered Ben. &ldquo;Load up, boys, and
when you shoot&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll make every shot tell,&rdquo; answered Jeming,
a hardy-looking soldier, almost as tall as his companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe they will come very close,&rdquo; continued
Ben. &ldquo;They know that we have the advantage
of them, even if we are but four to nine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young captain was right. The Filipinos
had showed themselves only for a few seconds.
Now, as Sorrel raised his gun, they lost no time
in darting behind cover.</p>
<p>The cottage consisted of four rooms, all on the
ground floor, and a low loft upstairs. It was well
built and fairly furnished in native fashion. On
the single bed it contained lay the wounded soldier,
Sergeant Kaser, whom Ben had met several times.
He was hit in the neck, and looked as if he
could last but a few hours at the most.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry we can&rsquo;t git ye back to camp, sergeant,&rdquo;
said Sorrel, as he did what he could to ease the
wounded one&rsquo;s pain. &ldquo;The house is surrounded
by the enemy. I reckon we kin keep &rsquo;em out,
but I reckon likewise thet they kin keep us in&mdash;at
least fer a while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&mdash;don&rsquo;t&mdash;matter,&rdquo; gasped Sergeant Kaser.
&ldquo;I am not&mdash;not&mdash;long for this world. What a
terrible thing war is! I never thought I was going
to be shot down like this!&rdquo; And he gave another
gasp. His eyes were staring from his head, for
he was suffering severe pain.</p>
<p>Ben looked around the cottage for something
which might be given to the sufferer to ease him.
But the dwelling had been stripped of all small
things, and nothing in the way of food, drink, or
medicine remained. Sorrel had already bound a
handkerchief soaked in cold water around the
wounded neck, so nothing more could be done,
excepting to raise the sufferer up to a sitting
position, at his request. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know as thet
is best fer him,&rdquo; whispered the tall Tennesseean to
Ben. &ldquo;But he ain&rsquo;t long fer this world, as he
says, an&rsquo; he might as well hev his wish as not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the meantime Casey and Jeming were on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
guard, one watching to the front and right, the
other to the left and rear. The nearest building
to the cottage was a hundred and fifty feet away,
but bushes and small trees were numerous, and
the Americans were afraid the rebels might try to
sneak up behind these and surprise them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something is moving over there,&rdquo; announced
Jeming, after watching several of the bushes for
a short spell. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t make out, though, if it&rsquo;s
man or beast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you plenty of ammunition?&rdquo; asked Ben,
who, as an officer, felt in charge of the party.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seventeen rounds, captain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how about you, Casey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fifteen rounds,&rdquo; returned the Irish volunteer,
after counting up the contents of his belt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have twelve rounds, captain,&rdquo; came from
Sorrel. &ldquo;But I reckon you know how I shoot,
an&rsquo; Jeming&rsquo;s jest as good, mebbe better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think the supply is sufficient,&rdquo; said Ben, &ldquo;so
don&rsquo;t run any chances. If you think that is an
enemy give him a shot. But don&rsquo;t hit one of
our fellows by mistake,&rdquo; he added, by way of
caution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a Tagal!&rdquo; cried Jeming, while the young
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
captain was yet beside him. The gun was levelled
like a flash, a report followed, and the Filipino
fell behind the bushes and was seen no more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thet will teach &rsquo;em to keep their distance,&rdquo;
was Sorrel&rsquo;s comment. &ldquo;Perhaps they&rsquo;ll clear out
soon, bein&rsquo; afeered some more o&rsquo; our troops will
come this way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the natives were &ldquo;game,&rdquo; as Ben expressed
it; and instead of withdrawing, they began to come
closer, using every bush, tree, and outbuilding to
the best advantage. Some of their fellows had
joined them, so that the attacking party now numbered
fifteen, and each well armed. They had
seen that Ben wore the uniform of a captain, and
felt that the capture of such an officer would be
much to their credit.</p>
<p>Sergeant Kaser was now groaning so that he
could be heard even outside of the building, and
as the rebels had fired through the windows several
times, they concluded that they had wounded one
of the four men they knew to be inside. If this
was so, but three <i>Americanos</i> were now left, and
they felt that victory would soon be within their
grasp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surrendor, or we kill eferyboddy!&rdquo; cried one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
of the number, in English that could scarcely be
understood. &ldquo;We haf dreety mens outside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ain&rsquo;t surrenderin&rsquo;, not by a jugful!&rdquo;
answered Sorrel. &ldquo;What in thunder does he
mean by &lsquo;dreety mens&rsquo;?&rdquo; he added, to his companions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think he means thirty,&rdquo; answered Ben. &ldquo;But
I don&rsquo;t believe there are that many.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but there are more than there was,&rdquo;
announced Casey, quickly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just afther seein&rsquo;
&rsquo;em pass yonder bushes.&rdquo; He had pointed his gun,
but the Filipinos had been too quick for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you surrendor?&rdquo; demanded the voice again.
&ldquo;We shall begin to shoot if you no gif up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No surrender,&rdquo; answered Ben, firmly.</p>
<p>Hardly had he spoken when something came
rolling toward the cottage and stopped close to the
porch. It was a rude ball made of sugar-cane husks
and over a foot in diameter. The ball was ablaze
and burning fiercely, as if covered with pitch.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>THE ESCAPE FROM THE BURNING HOUSE</h3>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo, that&rsquo;s a new wrinkle!&rdquo; exclaimed Ben.
&ldquo;They are going to try burning us out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, an&rsquo; thim haythins is up to all sorts av
dodges,&rdquo; cried Dan Casey. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s meself as would
like to git a squint at th&rsquo; feller that threw that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got him, I reckon,&rdquo; whispered Sorrel, taking
a ready aim at a thin hedge to the left of the
house. The report of his gun was followed by a
shriek of pain, and a Filipino fell into view, the
blood flowing freely from a wound in his neck.
Soon his companions caught him by the legs and
dragged him back into cover.</p>
<p>After this brief exchange of &ldquo;compliments,&rdquo; as
the tall Tennesseean called it, there came a lull.
Evidently the natives were disconcerted by the
unexpected fall of the man who had thrown the
fire-ball and knew not what to do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose they have quitted the vicinity?&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
questioned Jeming, after listening vainly
for some sound from without. From a distance
came a scattering fire, but around the native house
was the silence of death, for the man who had
been shot by Sorrel had fainted from loss of blood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are up to something, you can be certain
of that,&rdquo; answered Ben. &ldquo;The Filipino is at his
worst when he is silent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right ye air, cap&rsquo;n,&rdquo; put in Sorrel. &ldquo;Yere
she comes agin&mdash;an&rsquo; a scorcher, too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>From over the bushes came a huge fire-ball,
blazing brightly. It struck the thatch of the cottage
close to the edge of the roof, and before it
fell to the ground had set fire to the abode, which
began to burn as though no shower had wet it for
a month.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That settles it!&rdquo; came from Jeming. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve
got to get out, or we&rsquo;ll be burnt up like rats in a
corn-crib.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the sergeant&mdash;&rdquo; began Sorrel, when a low
moan issued from the corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never&mdash;mind&mdash;me, boys,&rdquo; came, with several
gasps. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m&mdash;I&rsquo;m going! Good&mdash;good&mdash;bye&mdash;to&mdash;to&mdash; Tell
mother&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said no more, but fell back exhausted. All
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
rushed to him, but ere anybody could raise his
form again he was gone from this earth forever.</p>
<p>Tears stood in the eyes of Ralph Sorrel, and Jeming
was scarcely less affected, for both had known
the sergeant intimately. &ldquo;Another victim,&rdquo; murmured
the tall Tennesseean. &ldquo;How long is this
yere blamed war goin&rsquo; ter last, anyhow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much longer, I hope,&rdquo; answered Ben, in
a low voice. &ldquo;I, for one, have seen enough of
bloodshed.&rdquo; Then the young captain straightened
up, for fear he might break down. &ldquo;But we must
attend to our duty, and get away if we can. See,
the flames are eating in at the window.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, cap&rsquo;n, I&rsquo;m ready,&rdquo; said Sorrel. &ldquo;But
we must carry this yere body outside fust. We
can&rsquo;t let it be burnt up, nohow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He nodded to Jeming, who understood, and
covering the form of the dead man with a blanket,
they marched to the door with the stiffening form.
The coast seemed clear, and they darted out and
deposited their grewsome burden on the grass.
They were just returning to the shelter of the
doorway when two shots rang out, but neither
was effective.</p>
<p>By this time the cottage was burning so fiercely
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
that to remain inside longer would have proved
highly dangerous. Accordingly, Ben called a council
of war.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we had best strike out for the grove
of trees on the right,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;The distance
is shorter than to the other shelters, and the
grass is so high that perhaps we can get some
benefit by stooping down as we run.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right ye air, cap&rsquo;n,&rdquo; answered Sorrel, and
Casey and Jeming nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surrendor, you <i>Americanos</i>!&rdquo; came in a shout
from without. &ldquo;Surrendor, you beasts!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let them burn up, they deserve it!&rdquo; came in
Spanish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All ready?&rdquo; asked Ben, and receiving a nod,
he hurried to a side window. Below was a small
bush, and in a moment he had dropped to the
ground. As he started through the long grass,
Casey and the others followed him.</p>
<p>A wild yell speedily showed that this new movement
had been discovered, and a dozen shots rang
out. But the Filipinos were too excited to shoot
straight, and the bullets merely clipped their way
through the mango and other trees, or buried
themselves in the side of the burning building.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span></div>
<p>At first Ben thought to fire in return. But to
find shelter was the prime consideration, and on
he went, holding his pistol in readiness, but without
pulling the trigger. Here and there a Filipino
could be seen flitting from bush to tree, but these
glimpses were short and far from satisfactory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are coming!&rdquo; came from Dan Casey,
just as the nearest of the trees was gained.
&ldquo;Back, ye rascals!&rdquo; he shouted, and fired as
quickly as he could. Casey was right; the Tagals
were surrounding them, and now they had to fight
back to back, in as hot a contest as the young
captain had ever seen. They were clearly outnumbered,
but retreat was impossible, for the
Filipinos surrounded them upon every side.</p>
<p>What happened during the next five minutes is
almost impossible to describe, for every movement
was executed with lightning-like rapidity, the Filipinos
bound to kill or capture the Americans, and
at the same time afraid that they would slip like
eels through their fingers. After a score of shots
taken at a distance, they closed in, and Ben found
himself confronted by two fierce-looking men, one
armed with a Mauser rifle and the other with a
wicked-looking bolo. The Mauser was empty, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
its owner evidently out of ammunition, for as he
advanced he used the weapon as a club.</p>
<p>Ben was hard pressed, for his pistol was now
empty, and there was no chance to reload it. But
his sword kept the two Tagals back, and had it not
been for his gun, one of the enemy would have had
his head split open from the blade. But now the
rascal with the bolo tried to attack the young captain
from one side, while he with the gun swung
around to the other.</p>

&ldquo;His sword kept the two Tagals back.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Page 147.</i><br />
</p>
</div>
<p>Ben could expect no aid from his companions, for
all were as hotly engaged as himself; indeed, Sorrel
more so, for he was fighting three men, while Jeming
and Dan Casey, side by side, and with their
backs against a heavy thorn-bush, were fighting the
balance of the detachment.</p>
<p>The young captain felt that he could do little or
nothing more, and expected each instant to have his
assailants hurl themselves directly upon him, when
a shout came from Sorrel which gave all of our
friends hope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some soldiers air comin&rsquo;!&rdquo; sang out the Tennesseean.
&ldquo;This way, boys, this way, an&rsquo; be quick
about it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; came in a hoarse growl
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
from the roadway, and in a few seconds a whole
company of the North Dakota troops burst into
view. Their captain, a short, fat man, but one who
was an excellent fighter, took in the situation at a
glance, and ordered the Filipinos surrounded.</p>
<p>Taken by surprise, the Tagals were dumfounded,
and for half a minute knew not what to do.
Then they started to run, but this movement came
too late, and four went down at the first volley from
the newly arrived men. The others, realizing their
helplessness, threw down their arms and surrendered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had it hot, eh, captain,&rdquo; said the North Dakota
man to Ben as he came up with a quizzical smile on
his round face, from which the perspiration was
pouring in a stream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; panted Ben. &ldquo;You came up in the nick
of time, and I must thank you for&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, captain&mdash;no more than you
would do for me, and I know it.&rdquo; The North
Dakota man shook hands. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a long running
fight to-day,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;Where is your
command?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That remains to be found out,&rdquo; answered Ben.
&ldquo;Have you seen any of them during the last two
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
hours? I and one of my men became separated
from them in the cane-brakes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;ll find them up near Baliuag. Most
of the troops are up there. But I wouldn&rsquo;t try
going around by this road, for the rebels are scattered
in small bands all over this territory. You&rsquo;ll
find the main road all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will you do with these prisoners?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take them up to the main road and send to the
colonel for orders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I will go with you,&rdquo; said Ben, and spoke
to the others about it. Soon the whole party was
on the way, Sorrel and Jeming carrying the dead
form of Sergeant Kaser between them, with Casey
trudging near to give them a lift whenever necessary.</p>
<p>It was now growing dark, and looked as if a thunderstorm
was at hand. Seeing this, the detachment
pushed forward rapidly, until at last the main
road was gained. Here, from one of the drivers of
a quartermaster&rsquo;s turnout, they learned that Ben&rsquo;s
regiment had gone into temporary camp on the outskirts
of the town of Baliuag, which was a mile further
on. A number of Americans were missing,
having become lost in a manner similar to Ben and
Casey.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span></div>
<p>The young captain now lost no time in marching
forward once more, and reached his regiment
in less than half an hour. He found his company
in charge of Gilmore. Many had given him up
for dead, and they were delighted at his reappearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t do without you,&rdquo; said the acting first
lieutenant. And as he shook hands his honest
face showed that he meant what he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t know that I can do without my
company,&rdquo; replied Ben. &ldquo;Anyway, I&rsquo;m awfully
glad to be back. In the future, I must be a little
more careful about keeping the boys in sight.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>NEWS FROM HOME</h3>
</div>
<p>It was evident that the majority of the insurgents
had now had enough of fighting, for while
the engagement just mentioned was taking place,
General Luna of the Filipinos sent forward his
chief of staff to General MacArthur, with a request
that hostilities cease, pending a conference
of Americans and Filipinos looking toward a settlement
of existing difficulties.</p>
<p>But our leaders knew only too well what delay
meant, and refused to enter into any compact
unless the natives first threw down their arms.
The Filipinos wanted their freedom, but events
had now so shaped themselves that absolute freedom
for them appeared to be out of the question.
So the conference practically amounted to nothing.
And while this was taking place, General Hale
began to move eastward to join General Lawton&rsquo;s
command on its march toward San Isidro. It was
the policy of all the American commanders to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
give the Filipinos no rest during the short time
left to them before the heaviest of the rainy season
set in.</p>
<p>A rest of two days did Ben&rsquo;s company a world
of good. Communications with Malolos were now
opened, and supplies were coming forward rapidly.
With the supply wagons came Carl Stummer, just
from the hospital and still somewhat &ldquo;shaky,&rdquo; but
eager to be again on the firing line.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could not dink me of stayin&rsquo; any longer,&rdquo;
he said, as he shook hands all around. &ldquo;Der docther
say, &lsquo;You vos besser here,&rsquo; und I say, &lsquo;I ton&rsquo;t
gits me no besser bis I schmell dot powder purning
vonce more alretty!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s powdher ye&rsquo;ll be afther shmellin&rsquo;
soon,&rdquo; put in Dan Casey. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s forward we go
to-morrow, so th&rsquo; colonel is afther sayin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goot!&rdquo; said Carl. Then he added with a faint
smile. &ldquo;You see, Tan, I vos afraid you kill all
dem Filibenos off pefore I could git here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure an&rsquo; I saved a couple fer ye, Carl,&rdquo; replied
his chum. &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ll not be wantin&rsquo; fer a scrap, I&rsquo;ll
warrant!&rdquo; And then he related his own and
Ben&rsquo;s adventures, to which the German volunteer
listened with much interest.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span></div>
<p>The wagon train had brought in the mail, and
this included the usual letters for Ben&mdash;one from
Walter and the other from Uncle Job Dowling.
Ben breathed a long sigh as he opened the communications.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to spring a surprise on you,&rdquo; so
wrote Walter. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been reading the newspapers,
and it makes me weary to think that I am just
cruising around with our squadron doing nothing,
while you and Larry are right in it, head and
heels. I&rsquo;ve applied for a transfer to one of the
warships in Manila waters, and it may be that
before this reaches you I will be on the bounding
Pacific on my way to join you and Larry in our
fight with Aguinaldo and his supporters. Si Doring,
my old Yankee chum, has applied with me,
so we&rsquo;ll probably come on together, and when we
get there you and Larry will have to look to your
laurels, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Walter!&rdquo; murmured Ben, after reading
the letter twice. &ldquo;What will he say when he
hears that Larry is missing? If Larry doesn&rsquo;t
show up, it will break his heart, and it will break
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
mine, too!&rdquo; And he brushed away the tears that
sprang up in spite of his efforts to keep them
down. Then he turned to the heavy, twisted
scrawl from his Uncle Job.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s rare good news you have sent, Ben,&rdquo; wrote
the old man, after stating that he was in good
health, &ldquo;and the news comes none too soon, for
the party who took a mortgage on my house wants
his money, and where I am going to get it I don&rsquo;t
know, with money so tight and interest and bonus
so high. I&rsquo;ve told him that Braxton Bogg is captured,&mdash;and
he saw it in the newspaper, too,&mdash;and
he is about of a mind to wait for his money now
until the bank gets back what was stolen, and
settles up. For myself, I can&rsquo;t hardly wait till that
time comes; and after this you can be sure I&rsquo;ll be
mighty careful where I put my cash and what&rsquo;s
coming to you three boys, too. You won that
thousand dollars&rsquo; reward fairly, and I hope you
and Larry won&rsquo;t squander it like most soldiers
would. I thought that war would end soon, but it
appears like it would go on forever. Tell Larry
to take good care of himself, and mind that you
don&rsquo;t get shot.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Uncle Job&mdash;he&rsquo;ll be in a hole again,&rdquo;
murmured Ben. &ldquo;Evidently he wrote this right
after I sent word Braxton Bogg was caught, and
he doesn&rsquo;t know anything of my being shot and
getting over it, and of Benedicto Lupez skipping
out with what Bogg stole. Hang the luck, but
everything seems to be going wrong.&rdquo; And Ben
grated his teeth, in a mood hard to explain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up, Ben?&rdquo; The question came from
Gilbert, who had just come up to watch the young
captain, in considerable surprise.</p>
<p>Ben showed the two communications. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
just thinking of what I had best write to my
Uncle Job,&rdquo; he returned. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it will
break the old fellow&rsquo;s heart to learn that the
money is gone&mdash;and after he is trying to turn
over a new leaf, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the news about Larry will cause him
pain, too, I reckon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt, but&mdash;but&mdash;well, between you and
me, Gilbert, I&rsquo;m afraid the money will hurt the
worst&mdash;Uncle Job always did set such a store by
a few dollars. As for me, I&rsquo;d give all I&rsquo;ll ever be
worth if only I knew Larry was safe,&rdquo; concluded
the young captain, arising from a seat under a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
palm tree as Major Morris came forward to speak
to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain, I&rsquo;m ordered to the front to-night, to
do a little reconnoitring,&rdquo; said the major of the
first battalion. &ldquo;I thought perhaps you would
like to go out with me. Possibly we can again
get on the track of that Bogg fortune;&rdquo; and
he smiled faintly, for he had been with Ben on
the night Braxton Bogg had been first made a
prisoner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go out with you gladly,&rdquo; answered the
young captain, promptly. &ldquo;But I doubt if that
money is ever found&mdash;or my brother Larry,
either,&rdquo; he added, with bitterness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, cheer up, captain, you are blue to-night.
Come, a little danger will put you on your mettle
once more, and you&rsquo;ll forget all about this thing&mdash;although
I&rsquo;ll allow it&rsquo;s enough to make anybody
heart-sick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Supper was served, and the sun had long since
sunk to rest over the vast plain and ocean to the
westward, when Ben and Major Morris set out,
taking with them an ample supply of ammunition
and likewise a day&rsquo;s rations, for they were to
move directly into the heart of the enemy&rsquo;s country
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
and might be absent for a day or longer. The
object of their going was to find out if a certain
Lieutenant Caspard, who had deserted the American
ranks, was with the rebels now gathering at
Maasin, and if so, whether or not he was acting
as an officer of the Filipino forces. If they could
catch the deserter and bring him back, they were
to be well rewarded. Strange to say, the orders
were not to shoot him if it could be avoided.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a strange mission,&rdquo; said Major Morris, as
they set out. &ldquo;But such are Colonel Darcy&rsquo;s orders,
and he is backed up in them by the general.
Between you and me, I think this Caspard has
been playing a double game between our forces
and those of the Filipinos, and those at headquarters
want to find out just what it means.
One man told me that this Caspard was out of
his head, and had an idea that he could stop the
war by telling the rebels we would grant them
everything they want if only they would throw
down their arms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would the rebels swallow such a yarn?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of the more ignorant might. But that
isn&rsquo;t the point; Caspard may have given them
some military information of vast importance.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
You must remember we are in a territory that
may be full of pitfalls for us,&rdquo; concluded the
major.</p>
<p>Ben thought but little of the ending of this
speech at the time, but had good cause to remember
it before midnight. On they pushed past the
picket guard and on to a side road which it was
said would bring them around to the north side
of Maasin. Both were in fairly good humor by
this time, and the major told many an anecdote
of army life which made Ben laugh outright. The
major saw that his companion was indeed &ldquo;blue,&rdquo;
and was bound to dispel the blues if it could be
done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that story puts me in mind of one on
General Grant,&rdquo; he continued presently. &ldquo;Grant
was sitting in his tent one night when&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; interrupted Ben, and caught his companion
by the shoulder. Then he pointed into
the semi-darkness ahead. &ldquo;Are those rebels, or
friends?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The road they were pursuing was, for the most
part, a winding one. But they had now gained
a straight stretch, the farther end of which was
somewhat in the open. Looking in that direction
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
Ben had discerned six or seven figures stealing
silently along, guns on shoulders and packs on
their backs.</p>
<p>Major Morris came to a halt and surveyed the
figures attentively. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe they are our
men,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;None of the troops came
as far as this&mdash;so the general stated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, if they are rebels, what have they been
doing?&rdquo; went on Ben. &ldquo;See, they have picks and
shovels and axes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it&rsquo;s an engineering corps,&rdquo; and the
major laughed softly at what he considered his
little joke. &ldquo;These Tagals are bound to be up-to-date,
you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if they are an engineering corps, what
have they been doing?&rdquo; demanded the young captain,
who felt by no means satisfied at his companion&rsquo;s
words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give it up&mdash;no, I won&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;ll go forward
and investigate,&rdquo; came from the major. &ldquo;There
they go, around the turn, and walking just as fast
as they can. If we want to catch up to them, we
will have to hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to get too close, major. They
are not the game we are after, remember.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;True, captain, but it won&rsquo;t do any harm to
find out what we can of them. We may be doing
General Lawton a great service by such an action.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The night was cloudy, and as they pushed forward
to the bend in the road it became darker
than ever, until they could see hardly anything of
what was ahead of them. The way was evidently
little used, for the grass grew thickly even in the
centre of the highway.</p>
<p>The pair were going on, side by side, and with
eyes strained to catch sight of those who had
gone before, when suddenly Major Morris felt the
ground giving way beneath him. &ldquo;My gracious!&rdquo;
he ejaculated, and caught Ben by the arm. At
the same instant the young captain uttered a cry,
and also felt himself going down. Then came the
snapping of slender bamboo poles, and the scattering
of some loose grass, and down into darkness
and space shot the pair, swallowed up utterly by
a hole which had unexpectedly opened to receive
them.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>IN AND OUT OF A STRANGE PITFALL</h3>
</div>
<p>Major Morris and Ben had fallen into a pit
dug by the Filipinos for the purpose of catching
their enemies. It was an old trick, and one which
had been used quite extensively at the opening of
the rebellion, but which was now falling into disuse,
for the reason that few Americans were ever
caught by the device.</p>
<p>The method was to dig a square hole in the
centre of some trail or road which the Americans
would probably use in their advance. At the bottom
of this hole would be planted upright a number
of sharp bamboo sticks, and then the top
would be covered over with slender bamboo sticks
and loose grass or palm leaves. If one or more
persons stepped upon the top sticks, they would
break at once, and the unfortunates would fall
upon the sharp points below, which were certain
to inflict more or less serious injury.</p>
<p>Fortunately, however, for the young captain and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
his companion, the hole into which they had tumbled
was not provided with the sharp sticks mentioned.
The natives had just finished the opening
when an officer had called upon them to leave
the vicinity as it was getting dangerous, owing to
the rapid advances made by the Americans. So the
trap had been set with its most dangerous element
lacking.</p>
<p>Yet the fall was by no means a pleasant one,
and for a brief instant the young captain of Company
D thought that the bottom had dropped out
of everything, and that he would surely be killed.
He tried to catch hold of something, but all he
could reach was the major&rsquo;s shoulder, and then
both landed with a thud on the soft dirt left at
the bottom of the hole.</p>
<p>Ben was the first on his feet, which was not
saying much, since the bottom of the opening was
not level, and he stood in the soft loam up to his
ankles. Shaking himself to find that no bones
were broken, he drew a long breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Major, are you all right?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no&mdash;I&rsquo;m not all&mdash;all right,&rdquo; came with
a gasp. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had my wi&mdash;wind knocked ou&mdash;out
of me.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Any bones broken?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I gue&mdash;guess not. But wh&mdash;who ever heard
of such a con&mdash;founded trick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard of it several times, major. But we
are not as bad off as we might have been had the
rebels put some sharp sticks down here to spit us
with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True.&rdquo; Major Morris gave a grunt, and wiped
the dirt from his eyes. &ldquo;Well, I reckon we&rsquo;ve
learned what their engineering corps was up to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was said so dryly that in spite of his discomfiture
Ben was compelled to laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we&rsquo;ve learned. The question is, now we
are down here, how are we going to get out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better make a light and see how deep the hole is
first,&rdquo; replied the commander of the first battalion.</p>
<p>Fortunately Ben had plenty of matches with him,
and striking one, he lit a bamboo stalk and held it
up as a torch. By the flickering light thus afforded
they saw that the hole was about eight feet wide and
twice as long. The level of the road above was fully
eight feet over their heads.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks as if we were in a box, eh, captain?&rdquo; said
the major, grimly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re certainly in a hole,&rdquo; responded Ben.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
&ldquo;But I think we can get out without much trouble.
I wish we had a spade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, wishing won&rsquo;t bring one, and there is
nothing here to take the place of one, either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing but our hands. Here, if you&rsquo;ll hold the
light, I&rsquo;ll see what I can do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is a bit of a flat stick, try that,&rdquo; rejoined
Major Morris; and taking the article mentioned, Ben
set to work with vigor, attacking one end of the hole
by loosening the dirt so that a large portion of it
soon fell at their feet. Standing upon the fallen
portion he continued his operations, and presently
more of the dirt fell, leaving an incline up which
both began to scramble on hands and knees. It was
not a very dignified thing to do, but it was far better
than to remain in the hole, and besides, there was
nobody at hand to comment on the want of dignity
in the movement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are well out of that,&rdquo; began Major Morris,
brushing off his clothing as he spoke. &ldquo;In the
future&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on, major, somebody is coming,&rdquo; interrupted
Ben, and pulled his companion back. He had seen
a faint light advancing toward them, from a side
road which joined the main road at a point but a few
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
yards distant. Soon he made out a heavy cart
approaching, drawn by a pair of caribaos, or water
buffaloes. On the seat of the cart sat two sleepy-looking
natives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must stop that cart,&rdquo; was the major&rsquo;s comment.
&ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t, there will be a bad smash-up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a good plan to expose ourselves,&rdquo;
replied Ben.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But do you want those chaps to break their
necks?&rdquo; demanded the commander of the first
battalion. &ldquo;More than likely they are <i>amigos</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a plan for warning them, major.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Ben spoke he picked up some of the driest of
the grass and palm leaves and applied a match to the
stuff. It blazed up readily, and he threw the mass
in with the other stuff about the edge of the hole.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, if they can&rsquo;t see that they must be blind,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;Come, let us get out,&rdquo; and off they ran
for the thicket close at hand. From here they
watched the cart and saw it come to a halt near the
hole and knew that the turnout was safe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t think the rebels would care to leave
those holes about,&rdquo; was Major Morris&rsquo; comment, as
they pushed on once more. &ldquo;They are as dangerous
to their own people as they are to us.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose they tell their own people about
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those men on the buffalo cart evidently knew
nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The rebels don&rsquo;t care for the <i>amigos</i>. Their
idea is, if a native is not with them, he is
against them, and must suffer with the Americans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To play the part of spies in such a country as this
was not easy, for the Americans were easily distinguished
from the natives. Had Ben and the major
spoken Spanish fluently, they might have passed for
Spaniards, as each was tanned from constant exposure
to the strong sun. But this could not be, and so
they had to go ahead and trust to luck to see them
through with their dangerous errand.</p>
<p>At length they felt that they must be close to the
enemy&rsquo;s picket line, and paused to consider the situation.
Before them was a gentle slope, terminating
at a small but deep stream which flowed into the Rio
Grande River.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think some of the rebels are over there,&rdquo; said
the major, pointing to a hill, from the top of which
could be seen a faint glow. &ldquo;There is certainly a
camp-fire back there.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;There is a house just below us,&rdquo; returned Ben.
&ldquo;Or is it a mill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A mill most likely. They wouldn&rsquo;t build an
ordinary dwelling right at the water&rsquo;s edge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps the rebels are using the mill as a
sort of headquarters. What do you say if we investigate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The major agreed, and they began to pick their
way along the stream. Soon they reached a rude
bridge, and were on the point of crossing, when a
sharp cry rang out from the building they were
approaching.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo, that&rsquo;s a woman&rsquo;s voice!&rdquo; exclaimed Ben.
&ldquo;Somebody is in trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help! thief! murderer!&rdquo; came in Spanish.
&ldquo;Oh, help, for the love of kind Heaven, help!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a woman, true enough!&rdquo; ejaculated the
major. &ldquo;I wonder what the trouble is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to find out,&rdquo; answered Ben. The cry
for aid appealed to his heart, and he bounded toward
the mill-house, for such the building proved to be,
without further hesitation. Nor was Major Morris
far behind him.</p>
<p>As they came closer they saw that the structure
was dark, saving for a faint light that came from one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
of the rooms built over the mill stream. It was in
this room, evidently, that some sort of struggle was
going on, for now both heard the cry for help
repeated, followed by the overturning of a table.
Then came the voices of two men, and the cry came
to a sudden end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two men are misusing some woman,&rdquo; cried Ben,
&ldquo;come on!&rdquo; and rushing around to the front of the
building, he found the rickety stairs leading to the
house floor, and bounded upward. The door at the
top stood ajar and he pushed it in, with Major Morris
at his heels. The room at hand was dark, the
struggle was going on in the apartment next to it.</p>
<p>Ben paused long enough to see that his pistol had
not sustained any injury in the tumble into the hole,
and was ready for use, and then threw open the door
before him.</p>
<p>The light in the room was not very bright, but
coming out of the darkness Ben could see but little,
for a few seconds. The room was thick with the
smoke of cigarettes, and through the haze the young
captain made out two men standing beside an overturned
table, one with a knife in his hand. To his
intense surprise the men were Americans and dressed
in the uniforms of regulars.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;What does this mean?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;What
are you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then Ben got no further, for a swift look
around the room told him that the two men were
alone&mdash;that the woman he had heard crying for help
was not there.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>THE ADVENTURE AT THE MILL-HOUSE</h3>
</div>
<p>For the moment it must be confessed that Ben
was absolutely dumfounded, and Major Morris also.
They had fully expected to see a woman in the hands
of the regulars before them, and they could scarcely
believe the evidence of their own senses.</p>
<p>But if the officers were astonished, the men they
confronted were likewise taken back, and stared
in amazement, which quickly gave way to consternation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; demanded one, as soon as
he could speak. And then he glanced over their
shoulders to see if the newcomers were alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We thought we heard a woman in trouble,&rdquo;
answered Ben, slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we did hear a woman,&rdquo; put in the major.
&ldquo;Where is she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two regulars exchanged unsteady glances, for
each was somewhat the worse for liquor. &ldquo;There
ain&rsquo;t no woman here,&rdquo; answered one of them, sullenly.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Then who was crying for help?&rdquo; persisted the
young captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here, cap&rsquo;n, you are on the wrong trail,&rdquo;
came from the older of the regulars. &ldquo;Me and
Bill&rsquo;s jest been having a little rumpus between ourselves.
We meant no harm by it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you,&rdquo; came from Major Morris,
promptly. &ldquo;There is some mystery here, and as
sure as you&rsquo;re born I&rsquo;m going to find out what it
is!&rdquo; he went on.</p>
<p>The major had scarcely finished when Ben&rsquo;s eyes
fell to the floor, and he saw the outline of a trap-door
under one of the regular&rsquo;s feet. One edge of
the door was raised about half an inch above the
floor proper, as if the door had been opened and not
put back evenly into place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Major, look at that trap-door!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
wager they used it while we were coming up the
outside stairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must be right, captain. If you&rsquo;ll&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t use no trap-door,&rdquo; shouted the
younger of the regulars, but he appeared much disconcerted
over the discovery Ben had made.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain, I have them covered,&rdquo; came from Major
Morris, as he brought out the two pistols with which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
he had wisely provided himself. &ldquo;Perhaps you had
better investigate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; returned the young captain, and backed
out of the room. The regulars wanted to stop him,
but aiming his weapons at them the major told them
to hold their peace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If everything is all right, you won&rsquo;t be harmed,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;But it doesn&rsquo;t look right to me. You
have no business here, for one thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what business have you here?&rdquo; demanded
the older regular. And then he changed his manner.
&ldquo;We were captured in the fight of last week, and
were just trying to get back to our lines again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll talk about that when my friend the captain
gets back, my man. If we are treating you
unjustly, I&rsquo;ll apologize and do the handsome thing by
you,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>In the meantime Ben was making his way down
to the bank of the stream, under the mill, with all
possible speed. It was extremely dark, and he
had to pick his way with caution for fear of tumbling
into some ugly hollow. Below the mill was
a fall of water, and here the stream ran between a
series of sharp rocks.</p>
<p>Ben had just gained the bank of the stream when
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
a low moan reached his ears. At first he could
not locate the sound, but presently discovered that
it came from the vicinity of the rocks. Feeling
his way along he managed, but not without great
difficulty, to gain the top of the rocks. Here he
saw the water foaming and boiling twenty feet
below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That woman must be down there,&rdquo; he muttered.
Then he raised his voice. &ldquo;Where are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down here, by the rocks!&rdquo; came back faintly.
&ldquo;Help! please help me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Locating the voice as well as he was able, the
young captain began crawling down from one rock
to another. This was difficult work, and he had
to move with extreme care for fear of a tumble,
which would land him directly into the boiling
stream. At last, however, he found himself perched
on a bit of a shelf, with the water less than two feet
away.</p>
<p>From this point of view he beheld the sufferer,
who was swinging in the water, with her arms
tightly clutching a sharp stone which reared its
point just above the surface of the stream. He
saw that she was evidently a Spanish woman, well
along in years, and that her dress was sadly torn,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
and her long hair was floating loosely over her
neck and face.</p>
<p>It must be confessed that the young captain was
perplexed over the situation that confronted him.
The sufferer was just beyond his reach, and he felt
that to plunge into the water after her would be
to take a big risk, for if the stream at this point
was over his waist, the force of the current would
carry him off in an instant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you hold on a few minutes longer?&rdquo; he
called out.</p>
<div class='figtag'>
<a name='linki_7' id='linki_7'></a>
</div>
<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/illus192.jpg' alt='' title='' width='332' height='500' /><br />
<p class='caption'>
&ldquo;Can you hold on a few minutes longer?&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Page 173.</i><br />
</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;No! no! I am too weak,&rdquo; came more faintly
than ever. &ldquo;Help me quickly, and Heaven will
reward you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will do what I can&mdash;but you must hold tight
for a minute,&rdquo; answered Ben.</p>
<p>Just above his head a number of bushes were
growing, and among these he had espied a long,
stout-looking shoot. Clambering to this, he pulled
out his pocket-knife and cut it off. Then he
leaped down once more, and holding tight to
the rocks with one hand, shoved out the branch
with the other. &ldquo;Catch hold, if you can,&rdquo; he
cried.</p>
<p>The woman understood and gave up the rock for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
the stick, and Ben pulled her toward him. It was
no easy task, and once it looked as if she would
lose her hold and be swept away. But in a minute
the danger was past, and the young captain was
hauling her up to where he stood. She was thoroughly
exhausted, and no sooner did he have her
in his arms than she fainted.</p>
<p>One difficulty had been overcome, but another
still remained, and that was to get up to the safe
ground above the rocks. But once again the
bushes growing out of the crevices came into
play, and, hauling himself from one to another,
Ben at last found himself safe, with his burden
resting heavily over his shoulder.</p>
<p>It was now that the young captain found the
woman was suffering from a blow over the left
temple, from which the blood was slowly trickling.
Laying the form down, he brought out his handkerchief
and bound up the wound as well as he
was able. This had just been accomplished when
the sufferer came again to her senses and stared
around her in bewilderment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you&mdash;am I safe?&rdquo; she asked, in broken
English, but in a sweet voice which went straight
to Ben&rsquo;s heart.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, madam, you are safe,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Did
those two men throw you into the stream?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes! Oh, they are villains, se&ntilde;or&mdash;great
villains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must say they look it, even if they are of
our troops,&rdquo; replied the young captain. &ldquo;Come, do
you think you can walk back to the mill with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman said she would try, and he assisted
her to her feet. She was still very weak, and
readily consented to lean on his arm; and thus they
moved slowly back the way the captain of Company
D had come.</p>
<p>During all this time Ben had not heard a sound
from the house, and he was anxious to know how
Major Morris was faring, although feeling positive
that the major was fully capable of taking care of
himself. Now, as they came closer, he heard loud
talking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to stay, major,&mdash;an&rsquo; it ain&rsquo;t
right fer you to ask us to,&rdquo; the older of the regulars
was saying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will stay, and that&rsquo;s the end of it,&rdquo; came
in the major&rsquo;s clean-cut tones. &ldquo;If you attempt
to pass through that doorway, I&rsquo;ll put a bullet
through you.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;But we are friends, major, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that I am a friend to you. It
depends upon what my companion the captain will
have to report when he gets back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t have nuthin&rsquo; to report, so far as we
are concerned,&rdquo; put in the younger regular. &ldquo;We
ain&rsquo;t done any wrong, &rsquo;ceptin&rsquo; to quarrel a bit
between us. Everybody has a set-to once in a
while, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time Ben was tramping up the outside
stairs, supporting the woman as before. Now he
pushed his way into the outer room of the mill-house,
the woman following with some hesitancy.
At the appearance of their late victim the regulars
fell back as though struck a blow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nice sort of chaps you are,&rdquo; exclaimed Ben,
hotly. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t deserve to wear Uncle Sam&rsquo;s
uniform. A set of prison stripes would suit both
of you much better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo, you&rsquo;ve found the lady,&rdquo; cried the major.
&ldquo;Sit down, madam, and tell us what this means.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A bench was handy, and the sufferer dropped
heavily upon it. The regulars looked as if they
wished themselves anywhere but in their present
situation, yet they did not dare to budge, for Major
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
Morris still held &ldquo;the drop&rdquo; upon them, and the
commander of the first battalion looked as if he
would stand no nonsense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These men came here to rob me,&rdquo; said the
woman, slowly. &ldquo;They are of your kind, but they
are not honest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then they are not of our kind,&rdquo; answered Ben,
promptly. &ldquo;We do not allow our soldiers to rob
anybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t come to steal&mdash;&rdquo; began the older
regular, when Major Morris stopped him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<a name='TC_4'></a><ins class='trchange' title='Removed extra double quote mark'>Silence!</ins> Not another word until the lady
has finished her story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a second of painful silence, and the
lady continued: &ldquo;I am staying at the mill alone,
for my husband has gone to the Laguna de Bay
on business. Several hours ago, these two soldiers
came in and demanded that I serve them with a
hot supper. Not wishing to have trouble I gave
them the best I had. But they were not satisfied,
and broke into my husband&rsquo;s wine closet and drank
two bottles of his choicest wine, and smoked his
best cigarettes, package after package. Then, after
drinking much wine, they demanded that I give
them money, and that man,&rdquo; pointing to the older
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
prisoner, &ldquo;told his companion that I must have
money hidden somewhere, as all the Spanish mill-owners
in Luzon were rich, while the truth is,
we are very poor, as the war has taken away
everything. Then the men drank more, and at
last they caught hold of me and threatened me
with great violence if I did not give up what I
had hidden away. I gave them the little silver I
had, but they were not satisfied, and when I tried
to run away, one hit me over the head with this
bench. Then they plotted to get me out of the
way entirely and go on a hunt for money themselves.
I cried louder than ever, and then you
started to come in. One of the men had opened
that trap leading to the river, and as you came up
the outer stairs both dropped me down, no doubt
to drown me. I was swept down to the rocks at
the falls, and there the <i>capitan</i> saved me, God bless
him for it.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3>NEWS OF LARRY</h3>
</div>
<p>For a minute after the Spanish woman finished,
nobody in the mill-house spoke. Her tale had impressed
both Ben and the major deeply, and they
looked with cold contempt at the two regulars
who had so disgraced the uniform they wore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a fine doings, truly,&rdquo; said Major Morris,
at length. &ldquo;I wonder what your commander will
say when he hears of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you please, they have deserted the American
army,&rdquo; put in the woman. &ldquo;They said as much
while they were drinking my husband&rsquo;s wine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t so!&rdquo; burst out the older regular,
fiercely. &ldquo;And that woman has told you a string
of&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo; interrupted the major, sternly. &ldquo;I
will take this lady&rsquo;s word against yours every time&mdash;after
what I have witnessed of both of you.
Your name, please?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t telling my name jest now,&rdquo; was the
sullen response.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Up came the major&rsquo;s pistol again.
&ldquo;Your name, I said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack Rodgrew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what is yours?&rdquo; went on the commander
of the first battalion, turning to the younger
regular.</p>
<p>The man hesitated for a second. &ldquo;My name
is Jerry Crossing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed! How is it your mate called you Bill
awhile ago?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe either of the names is correct,&rdquo;
went on the major.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is called Bill, and the other is Yadder,&rdquo; put
in the Spanish woman. &ldquo;I heard the names many
times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then that will answer, since I also have your
company and regiment. Now, then, throw down
your cartridge belts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Throw &rsquo;em down?&rdquo; howled the regular called
Bill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is what I said. Throw them down at
once.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;But see here, major&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t stop to argue with you. Throw the
belts down, or take the consequences.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what will the consequences be?&rdquo; questioned
Yadder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The consequences will be that I will form myself
into a court-martial, find you guilty of desertion,
and shoot you down where you stand. Come,
do those belts go down or not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon they go down,&rdquo; grumbled Yadder; and
unloosening the article, he allowed it to slip to the
floor, seeing which, his companion followed suit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now both of you hold your hands over your
heads, while Captain Russell searches you for concealed
weapons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ain&rsquo;t got no concealed weapons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t ask you to talk, I told you to hold up
your hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With exceeding bad grace the two deserters, for
such they really proved to be, held up their arms.
Approaching them, Ben went through one pocket
after another and felt in their bosoms. Each had a
long native knife, such as are usually used in the
rice-fields.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you do not call those concealed weapons,&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
was Major Morris&rsquo;s comment, as Ben came
over to him with the knives and the cartridge belts.
The rascals&rsquo; guns stood back of the door behind the
commander of the first battalion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t fair to take everything away from us,&rdquo;
began Yadder, when two shots, fired in rapid succession,
cut him short. The shots came from up the
stream and not over fifty yards from the mill-house.
Soon followed a shouting of voices, and all in the
place knew that a band of rebels were approaching.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are after somebody!&rdquo; exclaimed Ben.
&ldquo;They are coming&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young captain got no further, for just then
there sounded a clatter on the outer steps, and a
second later an American soldier burst into the
mill-house. He was in tatters, and his left arm hung
limply by his side, for he had been shot in the
shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Americans!&rdquo; he gasped, as he cast a hurried
glance about. &ldquo;Thank God for that! The rebels
are after me, half a dozen strong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He went up into the house!&rdquo; came from without,
in the Tagalog dialect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After him, men, the <i>Americano</i> must not escape
us!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span></div>
<p>And then footsteps were heard around the house
and on the stairs. Ben and the major looked at
each other questioningly. What was to be done?</p>
<p>&ldquo;The trap,&rdquo; whispered the young captain. &ldquo;If
they come up here, we can escape through that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no time to say more, for already the
rebels were coming up the stairs, shouting loudly for
the escaped <i>Americano</i> to give himself up. They
advanced in a body, evidently not caring to separate
in the darkness, and thinking to find the man
alone.</p>
<p>With quick wit Ben ran and placed the table
against the door, and on this piled the bench.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now the trap, and be quick!&rdquo; he whispered,
and Major Morris understood. Flinging open the
door in the floor he looked down, to behold the
stream flowing beneath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Follow me&mdash;it&rsquo;s the best way out,&rdquo; he said to
the escaped prisoner. Then he dropped down, holding
his pistols over his head, that they might not
get wet.</p>
<p>The wounded man was in a desperate humor and
lost no time in following. By this time the rebels
were hammering lustily on the door which Ben was
holding shut.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;What are we to do?&rdquo; demanded the older of
the deserters. &ldquo;Are you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can take care of yourselves,&rdquo; answered the
young captain, and rushing over to the trap-door he
let himself through, closing the trap after him.
Then came a plunge into the water, but the stream
here was less than four feet deep, and he followed
Major Morris and the wounded man to the bank
without difficulty. A loud shouting came from
overhead, followed by a storm of words from both
rebels and deserters, and also from the Spanish
woman. Fortunately for the woman, among the
rebels was a nephew, who at once came to her aid,
and had the two deserters from the American army
made prisoners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had better put a little distance between
ourselves and that mill,&rdquo; suggested Major Morris,
as all three shook the water from their lower
garments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is it? are you badly wounded?&rdquo; asked
Ben, turning to their newly made companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I can go ahead,&rdquo; said the soldier. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
rather painful, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take care of it for you at the first chance
we get,&rdquo; added Ben; and then the three set off at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
a brisk pace along the stream and over the rocks
to a grove in which they felt they would be comparatively
safe until daylight, if no longer.</p>
<p>As the mill-house was left behind, all became
quiet, and in the grove nothing disturbed them
but the hum of the insects and the occasional cry
of some night bird.</p>
<p>Lighting a match, Ben examined the man&rsquo;s wound
and bound it up with the major&rsquo;s handkerchief, his
own having been left behind with the Spanish
woman. The stranger said that his name was
Barton Brownell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been a prisoner of the insurgents for
some time,&rdquo; he said, when asked to tell his story.
&ldquo;I was captured just before our troops took Malolos.
They had six prisoners all told, and they
took us to a place called Guinalo, which is probably
forty miles from here, and up in the mountains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;While you were a prisoner did you see or hear
anything of a Lieutenant Caspard?&rdquo; asked Major
Morris, quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure I did!&rdquo; burst out Barton Brownell.
&ldquo;He came to see me several times. He has
joined hands with the insurgents, and he wanted
me to join them, too. But I told him I would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
rot first,&rdquo; added the wounded man, and his firmness
showed that he meant what he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And was Caspard in the field with the rebels?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. He was hand in glove with General
Luna and the other rebel leaders, and I think he
had turned over some messages from General Otis&rsquo;s
headquarters to the rebels. But, candidly speaking,
I think Lieutenant Caspard is somewhat off
in his head. Once he came to me and said that if
only I and the other prisoners would join him, we
could end this shedding of blood inside of a week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must be crazy, to join the rebels,&rdquo; put in
Ben. &ldquo;Does he hold any position under them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They call him <i>capitan</i>, but if he has such a
position, it is merely a nominal one. I think the
natives are beginning to suspect that he is not
quite right in his mind. But still they love to
hear him praise them, and they swallow a good
bit of what he says, like so many children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the moment Major Morris was silent. Then
he turned to Ben. &ldquo;Our mission seems to have
come to a sudden end,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Brownell can
tell Colonel Darcy all he wants to know.&rdquo; And
he related to the escaped prisoner the reason for
their coming beyond the American lines.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I reckon I can tell the colonel well
enough,&rdquo; answered Barton Brownell. &ldquo;For I saw
Caspard often, as I mentioned before, and he never
knew what it was to keep his tongue from wagging.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how did you escape?&rdquo; asked Ben, with
interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a very funny way,&rdquo; and the soldier laughed.
&ldquo;As I said before, we were kept up in the mountains,
in a large cave. There were six of our
troop, but all told the prisoners numbered twenty-eight.
There was a guard of four rebels to keep
us from escaping, and an old woman called Mother
Beautiful, because she was so ugly, used to cook
our food for us&mdash;and the food was mighty scanty,
I can tell you that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, one day two of the guards went off,
leaving the old woman and the other two guards
in sole charge. There had been a raid of some
kind the day before, and the guards had some
fiery liquor which made them about half drunk.
The old woman got mad over this, and she was
more angry than ever when one of the guards
refused to get her a pail of water from a neighboring
spring. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll get the water, mother,&rsquo; says
I, bowing low to her, and would you believe it,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
she made the two guards let me out, just to get
her the water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the water hasn&rsquo;t arrived yet,&rdquo; said Major
Morris, laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, the water hasn&rsquo;t arrived yet,&rdquo; answered
Barton Brownell. &ldquo;As soon as I reached the
spring I dropped the pail and ran for all I was
worth, and hid in the brush along the mountain
side. I stayed there two days and nearly starved
to death. Then they hunted me out, and I received
this wound. But I escaped them and made my
way through the jungle and over the rice-fields to
here, and here I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say there were twenty-eight prisoners all
told,&rdquo; cried Ben. &ldquo;Did you ever hear anything
of my brother, Larry Russell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Larry Russell?&rdquo; repeated Barton Brownell,
thoughtfully. &ldquo;To be sure I did. He is a sailor
from the <i>Olympia</i>, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! yes! And was he with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was, at first. But he wasn&rsquo;t when I left.
They moved some of the prisoners away, and he
was among them. So he was your brother? That
beats all, doesn&rsquo;t it&mdash;to think I should fall in with
you in such a place as this!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h3>THE ADVANCE UPON MAASIN</h3>
</div>
<p>Ben was much surprised and also delighted to
learn that Barton Brownell had met Larry, and he
lost no time in questioning the escaped soldier
regarding his missing brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, your brother was with me about two
weeks,&rdquo; said Barton Brownell. &ldquo;He came up with
a detachment of rebels from the Laguna de Bay,
after General Lawton left that territory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And was he well, or had he been wounded?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was suffering from a cut in the head. A
Spaniard had kicked him&mdash;and, yes, he told me it
was a Spaniard that you and he were after for having
robbed a bank of some money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Benedicto Lupez!&rdquo; ejaculated Ben, more astonished
than ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the name. Your brother had run across
that man and his brother at Santa Cruz, and he was
trying to make this Benedicto Lupez a prisoner,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
when the brother kicked him in the head, and then
both of them ran away, and when your brother
realized what was going on again he found himself
a prisoner. He was taken to a camp near the north
shore of the Laguna de Bay, and afterward transferred
to the cave where I was held.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am thankful that he is alive,&rdquo; murmured the
young captain, and breathed silent thanks to God
for His mercy. &ldquo;Do you know where they took
Larry to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say exactly, but I know that a great many
of the rebels are retreating to the mountains back
of San Isidro. I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised to hear of
Aguinaldo making his final stand there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would give all I am worth to gain my brother
his liberty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I reckon he would give all he is worth to
escape,&rdquo; rejoined Brownell. &ldquo;The boys hate to be
kept prisoners, and try all sorts of devices to get
away. One fellow had some gold hidden on his
person and tried to bribe a guard with it. But the
guard only laughed at him and stole the money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you do not know what became of
Benedicto Lupez and his brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, your brother knew nothing further than that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
they ran off after the assault on him,&rdquo; concluded
Brownell.</p>
<p>The talking had somewhat exhausted the wounded
man and Ben forbore to question him further just
then. While Barton Brownell rested easily on some
moss, the young captain turned to the commander of
the first battalion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall we do next, major?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we had better be getting back,&rdquo; was the
ready answer. &ldquo;The sooner we report to the
colonel the better he will be pleased.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel like pushing right through to San Isidro,
on a hunt for my brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be a foolish movement, captain, for,
unless I am greatly mistaken, the insurgents have
a large force in front of us, and to attempt breaking
through would be taking a big risk. Be thankful
that your brother is safe thus far. As long as he
remains quiet I don&rsquo;t think the rebels will harm
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ben could not but believe that this was good
advice, and he agreed to do as the major thought
best. It was now three o&rsquo;clock in the morning, and
half an hour later they started, thinking to rejoin
their command before daylight.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span></div>
<p>It was an exhausting tramp, the more so because
Brownell had to be assisted by one or the other for
the entire distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a great drag,&rdquo; sighed the wounded soldier.
&ldquo;Perhaps you had better push on and let me shift
for myself.&rdquo; But the major and the captain would
not hear of this.</p>
<p>They had one little brush with two of the Filipino
pickets before getting into the American lines, but
the rebels were young men and not very courageous
and let them slip by without great trouble.</p>
<p>It was Major Morris who made the report to the
colonel, taking Ben and Brownell with him. Colonel
Darcy was greatly interested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is, then, as I supposed,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This information
will be of great value to us, Major Morris,&rdquo;
and he thanked the major and Ben for what they
had done. Brownell&rsquo;s report was also received with
close consideration by General Lawton himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the prisoners have been taken to San Isidro,
we must try our best to liberate them,&rdquo; said the
general. &ldquo;I am so glad to learn, though, that the
rebels are not ill-treating them, as I had supposed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Ben, assisted by Casey, who saw Brownell
to the hospital and had the wounded soldier given
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
every attention. When they parted, Brownell, although
now so exhausted that he could scarcely
speak, shook the young captain&rsquo;s hand warmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you find your brother soon,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
can imagine how bad it makes you feel to know that
he is a prisoner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The advance of General Lawton&rsquo;s command was
now directed at Maasin, a few miles beyond Baliuag.
It was led by Colonel Summers, who took with him
some Oregon, Dakota, and Third Infantry troops
and a battery of the Utah Light Artillery, with
other troops following, including Ben&rsquo;s battalion
with Major Morris at its head. As before, the
advance was along the main road and through the
rice-fields, cane-brakes, and the jungle, with the air
so oppressive that it felt as though coming out of
a steaming oven.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dink me I vos right in it from der start,
alretty!&rdquo; exclaimed Carl Stummer, as he plodded
along. &ldquo;Dis vos vorse as der march on Malolos,
eh, Tan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s no picnic,&rdquo; replied the Irish volunteer.
&ldquo;But thin, Carl, me b&rsquo;y, ye must remimber,
we didn&rsquo;t come out here fer fun. We kem out fer
to show thim haythins how to behave thimselves an&rsquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
grow up into useful an&rsquo; ornamental citizens av the
greatest republic that iver brathed th&rsquo; breath av
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chust so,&rdquo; returned the German volunteer.
&ldquo;But it vos uphill vork, ennahow,&rdquo; and he sighed
deeply. Carl could fight as well as any old-time
trooper, but the long tramps through the jungle
always disgusted him.</p>
<p>There was the river to cross upon which the mill-house
was located, and Ben could not help but
wonder if the Spanish woman was still at the
structure, and how the American deserters had
fared. But the mill-house was too far away to
visit, and now the battalion was ordered into action
on the upper side of the stream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gangway for General Lawton!&rdquo; was the cry
that reached Ben&rsquo;s ears a few minutes later, and
then came a crashing of horses&rsquo; hoofs, and the tall
general rode through their open ranks, followed
by several members of his staff. As was usual,
the general was bound for the firing line, to personally
direct the movements of the men under
him. Many were the times that the members of
his staff urged him not to make a target of himself.
He would not listen; and in the end
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
this daring exposure cost the gallant leader his
life.</p>
<p>But now all was excitement, for a large force
of rebels had been uncovered and there was no
telling but what the jungle ahead concealed even
more. &ldquo;We are up against it, fellows!&rdquo; shouted
one of the sergeants. &ldquo;Let us rush &rsquo;em for
keeps!&rdquo; And on swept the battalion, until the
steady pop-pop of Mausers and the crack of the
Springfields could be heard upon every side.</p>
<p>Ben&rsquo;s company was no longer as large as it had
been, for death and disease had sadly depleted the
ranks. Yet the forty-six men in the command
were now thoroughly seasoned fighters, and all
loved their young and dashing leader and would
have followed him anywhere.</p>
<p>Presently an orderly dashed up to Major Morris.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Major, Colonel Darcy wishes you to take your
command up yonder hill. The rebels have a battery
up there, as you can see. If you can rush
the position, he will send another battalion to your
support.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell Colonel Darcy I will obey the order,&rdquo;
answered Major Morris. Then he turned to the
four companies. &ldquo;Boys, we are ordered to take
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
yonder hill and the two field-pieces perched on
top of it. Come on, and I will lead you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He waved his sword and away went the first
battalion on the double quick, two companies to
the front. There was first a slight hollow to
cross, and then came a thicket of brambles where
many a uniform was reduced to rags. The battery
at the top of the hill saw them coming and directed
a heavy fire at their advance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hot work!&rdquo; cried the major, as he ranged up
alongside of Ben. &ldquo;I am afraid the carrying out
of this order will cost us dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll allow me to make a suggestion, major&mdash;&rdquo;
began Ben.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make a dozen, captain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not take a course to the left then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For what reason?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a big rock on that side, on the very
top of the hill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we can&rsquo;t climb that rock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, and neither can the rebels fire over it with
their field-pieces. When we get up to the rock
we can march around it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well spoken, Russell&mdash;you&rsquo;re a born strategist,&rdquo;
cried the major, who was too generous to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
have any ill feeling because somebody offered him
a suggestion. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go that way.&rdquo; And he
immediately gave necessary orders.</p>
<p>But the advance was by no means easy, and
soon the battalion found itself under such a galling
fire that the men were glad enough to seek
the shelter of every rock and bush which came
handy. The battery could not do everything, and
afraid of having his pieces taken from him, the captain
had called upon several companies of the Filipinos
to assist him in maintaining his position.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down!&rdquo; suddenly shouted Gilbert Pennington,
and down went the men, and the next instant a
shell burst directly over their heads.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is hot and no mistake,&rdquo; murmured Ben.
Then he turned to his command. &ldquo;Forward, men,
the sooner we take that position the better it will
be for us.&rdquo; And up the hill he dashed, with
Casey, Stummer, and the rest following as best
they could, for the way was steep and uncertain.
At last the very edge of the big rock was gained,
and Company D poured around its left side, to
find themselves suddenly confronted by a body of
Tagalos fully a hundred strong. In the meantime
the other companies under Major Morris were coming
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
up on the opposite side of the rock. Ben was
on the point of shouting some additional words of
encouragement to his men, when he found himself
face to face with a mighty Igorrote warrior, who
with his long lance seemed determined to pierce
the young captain through and through.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<h3>CAMPING OVER A POWDER MAGAZINE</h3>
</div>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>It was the report of Ben&rsquo;s pistol, and the weapon
was aimed directly for the Igorrote&rsquo;s head, for the
young captain had learned the value of aiming and
firing quickly.</p>
<p>But the Filipino &ldquo;had been there before,&rdquo; and
as the trigger went down he dropped to the ground
with the rapidity of lightning, and the bullet intended
for him struck a man some distance in the
rear. Then up leaped the Igorrote once more and
bounded onward, the lance point aimed directly for
Ben&rsquo;s throat!</p>
<p>The young captain&rsquo;s pistol was now empty, the
other shots having been discharged during the climb
up the hill. His sword was out, but the lance was
three times the length of the blade, so he was still
at a disadvantage. Yet he aimed a blow at the
barbed point and thus turned it aside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; hissed the Filipino, and drew back. Then
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
he struck again at Ben, and instantly both slipped
on the moist grass and fell directly into each
other&rsquo;s clutches. The Igorrote was a powerful
warrior, and grasped Ben&rsquo;s throat with the tightness
of a steel band.</p>
<p>Ben tried to cry out, but not a sound could he
make. His eyes bulged from their sockets, and
he felt his breath leaving him. A second Igorrote
leaped forward to hit him on the head with a
war club, such as some of the Igorrote still insisted
upon carrying. Of the use of rifles this tribe of
the Filipinos knew little or nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Back, ye nager!&rdquo; came in Dan Casey&rsquo;s voice,
and there followed a sickening thud, and down went
the enemy with the club, his head split open by
a blow from the Irish volunteer&rsquo;s gun-stock.
Casey then aimed a second blow at the rebel who
had hold of Ben, but not wishing to receive such
a dose as had been meted out to his companion,
the other Igorrote sprang up, butted Casey in the
stomach with his head, thus landing the Irishman
on his back, and then ran for his life toward the
nearest shelter of brush.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, be gracious! To look at that now!&rdquo;
spluttered the Irishman as he arose. &ldquo;But I got
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
wan av thim, anyhow, captain,&rdquo; he added, with
a jerk of his thumb toward the Igorrote, who lay
with a broken head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Casey; and you saved me, too,&rdquo; returned
Ben, earnestly. &ldquo;You are worth two ordinary
men;&rdquo; and then captain and private drifted apart,
as the tide of battle rolled forward.</p>
<p>The top of the hill was gained, but for once the
insurgents did not know when they were whipped,
and held to their guns until more than half of
their number were either killed or wounded. The
contest raged to the right and the left of the battery,
and this was fortunate, for seeing they could
not hold the pieces, some of the rebels overcharged
one of the guns and set it off, blowing it into a
thousand pieces. Then the main body retreated
into the jungle, carrying a few of their wounded
with them.</p>
<p>By this time it was raining again, and the
downpour on the top of the hill was so great
that little could be seen of the condition of affairs
at a distance. Sending word that the hill was
taken and one old-fashioned Spanish field-piece
captured, Major Morris rallied his battalion around
him and stood on the defensive. But the rebels
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
had had enough of fighting for the present, and
once again took up the retreat in the direction of
San Isidro.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon that was hot enough for anybody,&rdquo;
said the major, as he stalked up to Ben and the
other captains under him. &ldquo;I wonder if anybody
was killed by the explosion of that old cannon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody was killed, but several were wounded,&rdquo;
answered one of the captains. &ldquo;The rebel who
charged her up and then fired her had lots of
nerve,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>Word soon came back from General Lawton that
the battalion should hold the hill until further
orders. The situation was not a pleasant one, but
orders must be obeyed, and the various companies
proceeded to make themselves as comfortable as
possible, which was not saying much, since the
top of the hill afforded little or no shelter. One
company was detailed to do picket duty, but
a little scouting soon proved that the rebels were
a mile or more distant.</p>
<p>When the main body of the troops under General
Lawton marched into Maasin, they found the
pretty little town all but deserted. In a few of
the huts the inhabitants remained, having hung
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
out dirty white rags to show that they were <i>amigos</i>.
Here were also numerous &ldquo;Chinos&rdquo; or Chinese,
some of mixed blood, and all ready to do
anything for the American soldiers, provided they
were paid for it. Natives and &ldquo;Chinos&rdquo; went
about bared to the waist, casting fearful eyes at
those who had so suddenly disturbed the peace of
their homesteads, for the inhabitants of Maasin
were peaceably inclined, and took but little interest
in the war Aguinaldo and his followers had
instituted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we are one step nearer to San Isidro,&rdquo;
remarked Gilbert, when he got the chance to talk
to Ben. &ldquo;I suppose we can&rsquo;t get there any too
quick for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Gilbert. You must remember
that while Larry may be near San Isidro now, he
may be miles off when we reach there. These
Filipinos change their capital and their prisons as
quickly as a flea jumps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, we&rsquo;ll keep them on the jump until
they drop,&rdquo; answered the young Southerner.
&ldquo;They can&rsquo;t stand up before us forever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To my way of thinking, I don&rsquo;t believe this
war will come to definite end, Gilbert.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, Ben? They have got to
stop sometime&mdash;or else we have got to stop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These Filipinos are not pulling together&mdash;on
the contrary, they are split up into half a dozen
factions. If we defeat one faction, the others will
still keep on, and, besides that, the worst of the
rebels are of Malayan blood, pirates and bandits.
I believe after we have whipped them as an army
they will still keep on fighting in small bodies,
somewhat after the order of the brigands in Mexico
and northern Africa. With the mountains to fly
to, such brigands could keep on worrying an
American army for years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly; but when the main body of the natives
see what we want to do for them, they&rsquo;ll be as anxious
as we to wipe out such brigands, and with their
own people after them, life will be pretty uncomfortable,
I&rsquo;ll wager. To be sure, there will always be
robbers, just as there are outlaws and train-wreckers
in the western states of our own country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some of the men had found a small opening
between the rocks, and over this had hung their
tents, making a rude shelter which Ben and Gilbert
were glad to share with them. In the crowd were
Casey and Stummer, and the latter busied himself in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
trying to make a cup of hot chocolate over a handful
of dry twigs found in the shelter. The attempt
was hardly a success, yet the drink was better for the
convalescent than either water or liquor would have
been.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, an&rsquo; if this shtorm kapes up, we&rsquo;ll all be
dhrowned out,&rdquo; was Casey&rsquo;s comment, as he shifted
his feet to keep them out of a rising puddle. &ldquo;Now
who would think the water would rise on the top av
a hill. Things do be mighty peculiar in Luzon, an&rsquo;
that&rsquo;s a fact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, Casey, you&rsquo;ll get back home some
day,&rdquo; put in another soldier. &ldquo;And in years to come
you&rsquo;ll be telling your grandchildren what a mighty
fighter you were out in the state of Luzon, recently
annexed to the United States, along with the state
of Hawaii.&rdquo; And a laugh went up over the conceit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure an&rsquo; you ton&rsquo;t haf nodding to grumble ofer
of you ton&rsquo;t git shot,&rdquo; said Stummer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or don&rsquo;t get taken down with disease,&rdquo; put in
another. &ldquo;My, but I pity the fellows with fever
and chills and malaria, and the other things that are
just as bad. I believe about one-fifth of the army is
now on the sick list.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of the boys are going to send a petition to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
General Otis for relief. They say they can&rsquo;t stand
it much longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the talk went on, both Ben and Gilbert saying
but little. Presently Major Morris poked his nose
into the opening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you boys had better come out of there,&rdquo;
he said shortly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, major&mdash;&rdquo; began several.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are we to advance?&rdquo; asked others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we are not going to advance, unless it&rsquo;s skyward,&rdquo;
continued the major. &ldquo;Either come out of
that, or else put out that fire, and be mighty careful
about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fire ain&rsquo;t doing no harm,&rdquo; grumbled a
private, under his breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe the enemy can see the smoke in
this rain,&rdquo; suggested another, thinking that this was
the cause of their being disturbed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not thinking of the enemy, boys, I&rsquo;m thinking
of you. Better come out, and then we&rsquo;ll put
out that fire as carefully as we can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seeing that something unusual was in the wind,
one after another of the officers and privates came
forth from the hollow, Stummer giving the fire a
kick as he passed. As soon as they were outside
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
they surrounded the commander of the first
battalion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, boys, do you know why I called you out?&rdquo;
asked Major Morris, with just the suspicion of a
twinkle in his clear eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, why was it?&rdquo; came from a dozen voices.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I wanted to save your lives,&rdquo; was the
quiet response.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Save our lives, major? You must be joking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I am not joking. We have just captured
one of the rebel gunners, who was in command of the
piece that was blown to atoms. He says that this
hollow, where you had your camp-fire, was their
powder magazine, and that they left all of a hundred
and fifty pounds of powder stored there, hidden
under the moss and dead leaves.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<h3>THE RESULT OF AN AMBUSH</h3>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good gracious, do you mean to say we have been
camping over a powder magazine?&rdquo; gasped Gilbert,
as soon as he could speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s a wondher we wasn&rsquo;t all blowed to
hivin!&rdquo; came from Dan Casey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Und I boil mine chocolate so calmly as you
blease,&rdquo; put in Carl Stummer, with a shudder. &ldquo;Py
chiminy, I ton&rsquo;t vos build no fire no more bis I vos
sure of mine ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For several minutes the excitement was intense,
and all of the soldiers retreated to a considerable
distance from the hollow which had proved such a
comfortable shelter.</p>
<p>Presently, however, Ben, Gilbert, and several others
mustered up courage enough to go back and haul
down the coverings put up. Then came another
heavy downpour of rain, which speedily extinguished
the fire; and the danger of an explosion was past.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span></div>
<p>An examination under the rocks proved that the
Filipino gunner had told the truth. The powder
was there, in big cans bearing the old Spanish stamp.
Some was marked 1876, and was so old as to be
practically worthless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They ought to have shot that off in honor of our
centennial,&rdquo; remarked the young captain. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
wonder the rebels can&rsquo;t hit anything. This powder
has no carrying power left to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nevertheless the powder was carted off and added
to the American stock. Then General Lawton rode
up and Major Morris told in detail what had been
accomplished.</p>
<p>With the fall of Maasin came another day of
much-needed rest for the majority of the troops
under General Lawton. In the meantime, while
these soldiers were advancing from Angat upon San
Isidro, the command under General MacArthur was
far from idle. The Filipino commissioners wanted
a three months&rsquo; armistice, in order that the terms of
a peace might be discussed, but to this the Americans
would not listen, as they felt the enemy wished
mainly to gain time in which to reorganize their
shattered forces.</p>
<p>MacArthur&rsquo;s command was now in possession of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
Calumpit on the railroad, and Apalit, just above, on
the Rio Grande; while the rebels in this territory
began to mass at St. Tomas and at San Fernando,
still further northward on the railroad. On May the
4th MacArthur&rsquo;s division set out from Apalit, with
Hale&rsquo;s command on the right wing and Wheaton&rsquo;s
on the left.</p>
<p>It was not supposed that the rebels would make a
serious stand short of San Fernando, but at St.
Tomas they were developed in force, and a running
fight ensued, lasting several hours, but without great
loss to the Americans. Finding they could not hold
St. Tomas, the Filipinos set fire to the town and fled.
They were pursued with vigor, and attempted to burn
San Fernando late that night, but failed to do so.</p>
<p>Early in the morning the fighting was renewed,
and near San Fernando another battle took place.
But the rebels were disheartened by the defeat at
St. Tomas, and were soon on the run, and General
Hale drove them a mile beyond San Fernando. In
taking possession of the town it was found that
several of the public buildings were in ruins. The
defensive works here were very strong, and had the
Filipinos stood up to their work like real fighters,
they might have held the position for a long time.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span></div>
<p>On Saturday, May the 6th, Ben&rsquo;s command moved
forward again, down the hill into Maasin, now
patrolled by Americans, and then to the main road
beyond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe we are in for much of a fight to-day,&rdquo;
remarked the young captain to Gilmore, who
had now been appointed first lieutenant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon you are right,&rdquo; answered Gilmore.
&ldquo;The scouts haven&rsquo;t found any rebels within a mile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would almost seem as if we could march
straight through to San Isidro,&rdquo; went on Ben,
thoughtfully. &ldquo;I must say I never heard of such
a campaign.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They say General Lawton puts it down as a
regular Indian campaign. But then the rebels don&rsquo;t
do much fighting in the dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are sick of it, Gilmore. I believe they
would give up in a minute if the leaders were only
assured that they would come out whole, as the
saying goes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they&rsquo;ve gone too far to come out whole,
captain. General Aguinaldo may mean well, but he
never went at this thing right. He ought to know
that he isn&rsquo;t dealing with some third-rate power.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On went the regiment, about four hundred and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
fifty strong now, for men were dropping out every
day on <a name='TC_5'></a><ins class='trchange' title="Was 'acount'">account</ins> of fever and other tropical troubles.
Ben had had a little fever himself, but had dosed
himself with quinine before it had a chance to permeate
his system and bring him down on his back.</p>
<p>The advance led the regiment along a small stream
lined with fading flowers and wild plantains and the
ever present thorns and trailing vines. Birds were
numerous, and here and there a sporting soldier
could not resist the temptation to bring one of the
feathered tribe down, to be cooked at the next resting
place. Once the regiment stirred up a flock of
wild turkeys, and a charge was made to capture the
prizes, a charge that was as enthusing as one on the
rebels. Soldiers are but human and must have their
fun, no matter under what difficulties.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fine turkey dinner we&rsquo;ll be afther havin&rsquo;
to-day,&rdquo; remarked Dan Casey, as he hung one of the
birds over his shoulder. He had scarcely spoken,
when pop-pop went several Mausers in a thicket
beyond, the bullets singing their strange tune in the
leaves over the advancers&rsquo; heads.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forward!&rdquo; shouted Major Morris, who was in
temporary command of the regiment, and away they
went once more, to suddenly find themselves on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
spongy soil which speedily let them down to their
ankles. In the meantime the insurgents&rsquo; fire became
thicker than ever, and it looked as if they were
caught in an ambush.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fire at will!&rdquo; came the order. &ldquo;To the left,
boys, and make every shot tell!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A roar of musketry drowned out the words, and
immediately Ben&rsquo;s company found itself all but surrounded.
To go into this quagmire had certainly
been a grave error, but all leaders make mistakes
sometimes; and Major Morris was suffering as
greatly as his men.</p>
<p>The next half hour was one Ben never forgot.
The rebels evidently thought they had the Americans
at their mercy and pushed in closer and closer,
until more than half of the contestants were fighting
hand to hand. Many had exhausted their ammunition,
and were using their bayonets or else handling their
guns as clubs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Die!&rdquo; cried one tall Tagal, as he flashed up
before Ben with a bloody bolo. &ldquo;Die!&rdquo; he repeated
in bad English, and made a lunge at the young captain.
But Gilmore had his eye on the man, and the
lieutenant&rsquo;s sword cut the bolo from the rebel&rsquo;s
grasp.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Good for you!&rdquo; cried Ben. Then he drew a
long breath, to think of the narrow escape he had
had. The native, his hand flowing with blood,
retreated as suddenly as he had approached.</p>
<p>The tide of the battle was now taking Americans
and insurgents toward a cane-brake. The rebels
still fought desperately, but they were beginning to
lose confidence, for the Americans were pushing
them hard.</p>
<p>But now came a cheer from the rear, and Company
B rushed up to the aid of Ben&rsquo;s command. To the
young captain&rsquo;s astonishment, Gilbert was in command,
all the upper officers being either killed or
wounded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gilbert!&rdquo; he called, but had no time to say
more. But the young Southerner heard and waved
the sword he had picked up. Soon the two companies
were fighting shoulder to shoulder, and the
enemy were driven out into the cane-field, and then
into a meadow. Here they tried to make a stand,
around an old rice-house, and it took another half
hour to dislodge them. But when they did retreat
at last, they went in great haste, many leaving their
weapons and outfits behind them.</p>
<p>The fighting over, Ben started to find the major.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
Gilbert accompanied him. Their first hunt for the
commander, however, was unsuccessful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s queer,&rdquo; was Ben&rsquo;s comment. &ldquo;I trust he
isn&rsquo;t dead in the bushes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hunt gradually brought them to a trail
through the jungle, and presently Gilbert heard
a faint moan for help. Running in the direction,
they found a soldier of Company C lying on
some moss, his knee shattered from a Mauser
bullet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the pain!&rdquo; groaned the poor fellow.
&ldquo;Help me, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do all we can for you,&rdquo; answered Ben, and
while he went to work, Gilbert ran back to bring up
the hospital corps with a stretcher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want to go after Major Morris,&rdquo; said the
wounded soldier, as soon as he felt comfortable
enough to talk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are looking for Major Morris,&rdquo; replied
Ben, much astonished. &ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was knocked over by one of the Dagos,
and then three of &rsquo;em carried him away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was certainly news, and Ben waited impatiently
for Gilbert to get back. As soon as the
young Southerner returned, both asked the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
wounded soldier in what direction the captured
major had been taken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They went through the cane-brake,&rdquo; was the
answer. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find the trail easily enough, I
think, if you look for it. One of the rebs wore
boots with high heels, so you can&rsquo;t miss &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wounded man did his best to point out the
right direction, and was then taken back to the
hospital tent. Without delay Ben called Ralph
Sorrel and half a dozen others to his aid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must go after Major Morris, and at once,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;Are you ready to undertake the work?
It may be a dangerous proceeding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re with yer, cap&rsquo;n,&rdquo; answered Sorrel, and
his sentiment was that of all of the others.</p>
<p>The trail into the cane-brake was followed without
much difficulty, and the party of eight advanced
as rapidly as the nature of the ground permitted.
The storm had cleared off the night before, and
the sun shone down hotly, making the air in the
brake suffocating.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This yere is a putty big cane-brake, an&rsquo; no
error,&rdquo; remarked Sorrel, after a quarter of a mile
had been covered. &ldquo;Cap&rsquo;n, it won&rsquo;t do fer us to
turn ourselves about an&rsquo; git lost.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll stick to the one trail,&rdquo; answered Ben.
&ldquo;As yet I&rsquo;ve seen no side trails, although I&rsquo;ve
been watching every foot of the ground that we
crossed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor I, cap&rsquo;n,&mdash;an&rsquo; don&rsquo;t wan&rsquo;t to, neither,&rdquo;
added the tall mountaineer.</p>
<p>A little further on was a clearing, in the centre
of which stood a small cane-house. Halting on
the edge of the opening, they beheld several Filipinos
on guard outside the house. In the doorway,
with his back to the opening, stood Major Morris,
his hands bound behind him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
<h3>THE TORNADO IN THE CANE-BRAKE</h3>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon we have got &rsquo;em tight, cap&rsquo;n,&rdquo; came
from Sorrel, as the party of Americans came to a
halt and surveyed the scene before them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It depends upon how many of them there are,&rdquo;
answered Ben. &ldquo;Sorrel, supposing you skirt the
clearing and try to count noses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Tennesseean was willing, and started off,
taking Gilbert with him. He was gone probably
ten minutes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not more than ten at the most,&rdquo; he reported.
&ldquo;And of that number two are wounded and have
their arms in slings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any other prisoners besides Major Morris?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that we could see,&rdquo; came from Gilbert.
&ldquo;We could rush them easily enough if it wasn&rsquo;t
for the major,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want any harm to befall Major
Morris,&rdquo; said Ben, thoughtfully. &ldquo;If we&mdash; The
rebels have discovered us, look out!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span></div>
<p>Ben had scarcely finished when a report rang
out and a bullet whizzed over their heads. One
of the soldiers outside of the cane-house had seen
two of the Americans and had fired upon them.</p>
<p>The discharge of the firearm caused Major Morris
to turn around, and as he did so Ben waved his cap
at his commander, and was recognized. Then two
of the insurgents hurried the major out of sight.</p>
<p>The Americans were not slow to return the fire;
and, although nobody was struck, the insurgents
lost no time in disappearing from view. A lull
followed, as both sides tried to determine what was
best to be done next.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here comes a flag of truce,&rdquo; said Gilbert, presently,
as a rebel appeared, holding up a white rag.
&ldquo;If I were you, I wouldn&rsquo;t honor it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would like to hear what they have to say,&rdquo;
replied Ben, quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But remember how they fired on the other flag
of truce,&rdquo; insisted the young Southerner. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
be running your head into a lion&rsquo;s mouth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorrel, keep that man covered,&rdquo; said Ben. &ldquo;I
won&rsquo;t move out any further than he does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you go, I&rsquo;ll go with you,&rdquo; said Gilbert,
promptly.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span></div>
<p>He would not be put off, and together Ben and
he moved into the opening, Ben holding up a new
handkerchief as he walked. The rebel at once
halted, as if expecting them to come over to where
he stood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You come over here!&rdquo; cried Gilbert, and waved
his hand.</p>
<p>There was a full minute&rsquo;s delay, and then of a
sudden the rebel threw down his white flag and sped
toward the house. At the same time three reports
rang out, and Gilbert fell back, struck in the
shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did I tell you!&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;They are
treacherous to the last degree!&rdquo; And then the
young Southerner fainted.</p>
<p>As just mentioned, three reports had rung out,
but only two had come from the house. The third
came from Ralph Sorrel&rsquo;s weapon, and the man
who had carried the pretended flag of truce fell
dead in his tracks.</p>
<p>The dastardly attack angered Ben beyond endurance,
and leaving Gilbert resting comfortably on
some cut cane, he leaped to the front. &ldquo;Come,
boys, we will root them out!&rdquo; he cried, and ran on
toward the house as fast as he could, firing as he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
went. Sorrel was at his heels, and the others fired,
each &ldquo;red-hot&rdquo; as they afterward expressed it.</p>
<p>The insurgents saw them coming and fired several
shots, but nobody was struck, and in a trice the
house was surrounded. Then Major Morris came
bounding through a window, and it was Ben who
cut his bonds with a pocket-knife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw it all,&rdquo; exclaimed the major. &ldquo;Go for
them, men, every one of the rascals deserves death!&rdquo;
And stooping over the dead rebel, he took from his
bosom a bolo and joined in the attack. &ldquo;They are
a pack of cowards&mdash;a mere set of camp followers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The major was right; the rebels in the house
were no regularly organized body, and at the first
sign of real peril they fled by the back way, over a
ditch and straight for the nearest jungle. But our
friends were determined that they should not escape
thus easily, and pursued them for nearly half a mile,
killing one more and wounding three others. Long
afterward they learned that those who had thus forfeited
their lives were bandits from the mountains
back of San Isidro. They had joined the forces
under General Aguinaldo, merely for the booty to
be picked up in the towns through which the rebel
army passed.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span></div>
<p>As soon as the contest had come to an end, Ben
hurried back to where he had left Gilbert. The
wound from which the young Southerner was suffering
was painful, but not dangerous. Yet it was
likely to put Gilbert in the hospital for the best part
of a month.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too bad&mdash;I thought I could see the thing
through to the end,&rdquo; said Gilbert, shaking his head
dolefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to take your dose as I did,&rdquo; answered
Ben. &ldquo;I am glad it is not serious. Our
regiment couldn&rsquo;t afford to lose such a brave fellow
as you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brave? Didn&rsquo;t I hang back until you proposed
to go out alone, Ben? If anybody was brave, it was
you,&rdquo; and then Gilbert turned his face away to conceal
the pain that was coming on.</p>
<p>The hospital corps was so busy that Gilbert could
not be carried back of the firing line for some time.
Feeling that there would be no more fighting that
day, Ben decided to remain by his old chum, and
requested Sorrel to do likewise, leaving the others
to accompany Major Morris back to the command
proper. In the meantime, a skirmish line was
stretched to the north of the cane-brake, that the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
insurgents might not regain any of the lost territory.</p>
<p>It was frightfully hot, but scarcely had Major
Morris left with his party than a faint breeze sprang
up which gradually increased to a fair-sized wind.
Making Gilbert as comfortable as possible under
some of the tallest of the cane, Ben and Sorrel sat
down beside him to do what they could to help him
forget his pain.</p>
<p>The three had been sitting in the shade for the
best part of half an hour, and Sorrel was sharpening
his knife on the side leather of his shoe, when,
glancing up, Ben noticed a peculiar cloud in the sky
overhead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That looks rather queer,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;Does
that denote a wind-storm, Sorrel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It denotes something, that&rsquo;s sartin,&rdquo; responded
the mountaineer, surveying the cloud with care.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s something I ain&rsquo;t seed out yere yit,&rdquo; and he
leaped to his feet.</p>
<p>The cloud was about as large as a barrel in appearance,
and of a deep black color. It seemed to
be whirling around and around, and as it came forward
began to expand. Then it shot off to the
southward, but not out of sight.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad it&rsquo;s gone,&rdquo; said Gilbert, who had
roused up to watch the strange thing. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
want to get caught in a western cyclone&mdash;and that
cloud looks like those I have heard described.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The rainy season is coming on here, and I presume
we are bound to have more or less tornadoes,&rdquo;
answered Ben. &ldquo;They say that last year they were
something awful along the seacoast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cloud was circling around the southern horizon,
but now it turned once again and came slowly
toward them. While it was yet quarter of a mile
away, it shot down to earth and a strange humming
sound reached their ears, followed by a whistling
that caused each of them to shiver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a whirlwind!&rdquo; yelled Sorrel. &ldquo;Come into
yonder hollow, cap&rsquo;n!&rdquo; and he caught hold of Gilbert
and lifted him up. The hollow he mentioned
was less than fifty feet away, yet to reach it in time
was almost impossible, so swiftly did the tornado
approach them. The air became black as night and
was filled with cane, grass, and branches of trees.
It struck the house in the clearing, and with a single
mighty crash the structure went up into the air,
to fall with another crash a hundred yards beyond.</p>
<p>Running with the tall Tennesseean, Ben pitched
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
into the hollow just as the first of the tornado hurled
itself at them. Down came the mountaineer, but
taking good care that Gilbert should not be hurt by
his quick leap. Then all fell flat, with their faces
to earth.</p>
<p>It was like some horrible nightmare to Ben,&mdash;the
whistling wind and the strange humming, the blackness,
and the whirling cane and tree limbs. In
some places the ground was furrowed up as by a
plough, and down on their heads came dirt and
grass, and then a shower of stalks that buried them
completely. And still the wind kept up, in a madder
gallop than ever. Ben felt as if every moment
was going to be his last.</p>
<p>The time was an age; yet by the watch it was not
yet five minutes when the tornado had departed,
leaving its track of ruin behind. But still the party
of three under the cane-stalks lay still, wondering if
it was safe to get up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do yer calkerlate it&rsquo;s over, cap&rsquo;n?&rdquo; came from
Sorrel, after a painful pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It appears to be, but there is no telling what
such a thing will do next,&rdquo; answered the young captain,
as he pressed on the stalks over him, and got
up. &ldquo;Gilbert, are you hurt?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; came with a gasp. &ldquo;But, Ben, that was&mdash;was
a terror, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was, Gilbert, and something I never want to
witness again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time Sorrel was also on his feet and hauling
Gilbert into daylight. The cloud was gone, and
the sun shone as brightly as ever. But at a great
distance they saw the tornado sweeping up into the
mountains.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are well out of it,&rdquo; was Ben&rsquo;s comment, as
they watched the cloud until it was out of sight.
&ldquo;That played sad havoc here. I wonder what it
will do in the mountains?&rdquo;</p>
<p>No one could answer that question, and no one
tried. Ben would have been very much surprised
had anybody told him that the same tornado which
had visited him was also to visit his brother Larry.
But so it proved, as we shall speedily see.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
<h3>THE FLIGHT FOR LIBERTY</h3>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, this is getting too monotonous for anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Larry who spoke, and he sat on the stump
of a tree at the mouth of a wide cave, gazing disconsolately
at a fire which several insurgents were
trying to build.</p>
<p>The place was on the top of a high hill, backed up
by still higher mountains. On every hand were
sharp rocks and trees, with a tangle of thorns.
Small wonder, then, that Aguinaldo and his cohorts
considered these fastnesses inaccessible for American
troops. No regular body could have gotten to such
a place, and to forward supplies hither was totally
out of the question.</p>
<p>The rebels numbered fifteen, all mountaineers and
strong. At General Luna&rsquo;s request they had brought
ten prisoners to the spot, and the other prisoners
were to come up some time later. Why the Filipinos
thus divided the men they had taken is not definitely
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
known, yet divided they were, until some escaped
and others died or were given up.</p>
<p>Since Larry had been captured he had passed
through half a dozen different hands. It must be
said he had been treated fairly well, better, perhaps,
than many of my readers may suppose. To be sure,
his clothing was in rags and his shoes were almost
minus their soles, but in these respects he was no
worse off than those who kept him captive. Then,
too, the food given him was very plain, but the rebels
ate the same, and to complain, therefore, would have
been worse than useless.</p>
<p>Larry had missed Barton Brownell, for the pair
had been fairly friendly, as we know. With the
transferal to new quarters the young sailor had
struck up an acquaintanceship with Dan Leroy, one
of the <i>Yorktown&rsquo;s</i> men, also a prisoner. A number
of the sailors from the <i>Yorktown</i>&mdash;in fact, a boatload,
had been captured, but Leroy had become separated
from his messmates at the very start.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is monotonous, lad,&rdquo; said Leroy, who was
resting at Larry&rsquo;s feet. &ldquo;But, as I&rsquo;ve said a hundred
times afore, we can&rsquo;t help ourselves, consequently,
make the best on it. Ain&rsquo;t that sound argyment,
lad?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon so, Leroy, but&mdash;but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When ye git as old as I am you&rsquo;ll see things in a
different light. We can&rsquo;t complain o&rsquo; the treatment
here, lad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I would like to know how the war is going,
and if my brother knows I am alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reckon the war is goin&rsquo; agin the Tagals, or they
wouldn&rsquo;t be a-pushing back into the mountains like
this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a wonder they don&rsquo;t try to exchange us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this Dan Leroy smiled grimly. &ldquo;Might be as
how they consider us too vallyble,&rdquo; he suggested.
He was a short, stout fellow, much given to joking,
and rarely out of good humor.</p>
<p>It was about the middle of the afternoon, and
from a long distance came the sounds of firing.
But the booming came from big field-pieces, so
Larry knew it must be far away, and so it gave him
small hope.</p>
<p>The rebels had just brought in some fresh meat,
procured from the town at the foot of the long hill,
and they speedily proceeded to make a beef stew
with rice and yams. The smell was appetizing, and
as nobody had had a square meal that day, Larry
brightened over the prospect.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span></div>
<p>The cave in the hillside was irregular in shape,
running back to a series of openings which nobody
had ever yet explored. In this cave the insurgents
kept some of their supplies, brought up from San
Fernando, San Isidro, and other places. It was a
fact that Aguinaldo hardly knew where to &ldquo;jump&rdquo;
next.</p>
<p>Before nightfall the dinner was ready, and the
chief of the rebels had the prisoners supplied with
bowls of the stew. &ldquo;Eat all of eet,&rdquo; he said, with
a grin. &ldquo;For maybe no geet such t&rsquo;ings to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, we&rsquo;ll fill up then,&rdquo; responded Larry,
and set to with a will, as did all the other prisoners.</p>
<p>The captives were unarmed, and though the rebels
watched them, they were allowed more or less of the
freedom of the camp. Finishing his bowl of stew,
Larry leaned over to where Leroy sat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leroy, if we can manage to get a kettle of that
stew, I&rsquo;ll be for trying to get away to-night,&rdquo; he
whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how are ye going to get it, lad?&rdquo; asked the
sailor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait and you will see,&rdquo; was the answer, and
Larry arose and sauntered over toward the fire.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I spilt some of the stew on the ground,&rdquo; he said,
which was true, although the amount had not been
large. &ldquo;Can I have more?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, take what you will,&rdquo; returned the insurgent
chief, who felt in good humor, through having
obtained a leave of absence, to start on the morning
following. &ldquo;And give some to your friends.
We&rsquo;ll fill up for once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; answered Larry, and hurried to the
other prisoners with the big pot from over the fire.
The prisoners had a large tin kettle for water, fitted
with a cover so that bugs might be kept out, and
this he filled to the brim, and also gave the others
all they wished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going to eat all of that?&rdquo; queried one of the
men, with a short laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometime&mdash;not now,&rdquo; answered Larry. Then
he took the pot back to the fire and carried his bowl
and the kettle into the cave. At once Leroy
followed him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, what&rsquo;s this nonsense you&rsquo;re talkin&rsquo;
about running away?&rdquo; demanded the <i>Yorktown</i>
sailor, as soon as they were alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to try my luck to-night, Leroy. If
you don&rsquo;t want to go, you can stay with the others.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;But how are you going? There&rsquo;s a guard
around the foot of the hill, and they will shoot you
on sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to try the foot of the hill&mdash;at
least, not this side of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you can&rsquo;t get to the other, for that cliff
over this cave is in the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to explore the caves back of this.
They must lead to somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old sailor shook his head. &ldquo;More&rsquo;n likely
they lead to the bowels of the earth. You&rsquo;ll fall
into some pitfall, and that will be the end of
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll light a torch as soon as I am out of sight of
this place, and I&rsquo;ll be very careful where I step.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This cave may be as big as the Mammoth Cave
of Kentucky. You&rsquo;ll get lost in one of the chambers
and never find your way out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to risk that. But I&rsquo;m bound to try
it&mdash;if they give me the chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re foolish. Why, confound it, I&rsquo;ve half of
a mind to report the scheme.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Leroy, surely you won&rsquo;t do that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean just to save you from yourself, Larry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t intend to remain a prisoner until I am
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
baldheaded, Leroy. I&rsquo;m going to try to escape&mdash;and
that&rsquo;s the end of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you take any of the others along?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they want to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There won&rsquo;t a soul go&mdash;and I know it,&rdquo; responded
the stout sailor, in positive tones.</p>
<p>When the other prisoners came in, he told them of
Larry&rsquo;s plan. One and all of them agreed it was
foolhardy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe there is any opening,&rdquo; said one.
&ldquo;Or if there is, it&rsquo;s so high up in the mountains that
you&rsquo;ll never reach it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what are you going to do for eating?
That kettle of stew won&rsquo;t last forever,&rdquo; said
another.</p>
<p>So the talk ran on, but the more he was opposed,
the more headstrong did Larry become&mdash;and that,
as old readers know, was very much like him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall go, and good-bye to all of you,&rdquo; he said,
in conclusion. And then he shook hands with one
after another, Leroy last of all. The <i>Yorktown&rsquo;s</i>
man was trembling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hate ter see ye do it, lad,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It seems
like going to death, but&mdash;but&mdash;hang it, I&rsquo;ll go
along, so there!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;But you needn&rsquo;t if you don&rsquo;t wish to,&rdquo; protested
the youth. &ldquo;I am not afraid to go alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I am a-going, and we&rsquo;ll sink or swim
together, Larry. Who else goes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan Leroy, looked from one face to the next.
But not another prisoner spoke, for each had taken
a short walk to the rear caves and seen quite enough
of them. Then a guard came in, and the strange
meeting broke up immediately.</p>
<p>The prisoners lay down to rest, but not one of
them could go to sleep. All of the others were
waiting for Larry and Leroy&rsquo;s departure. At last,
satisfied that all was right for the night, the guard
went outside, to join several of his companions
around the camp-fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, then,&rdquo; whispered Larry, and arose, to be
followed immediately by Dan Leroy. The kettle
secured, they hurried for the rear of the outer cave,
without so much as looking at the others, who raised
up to watch their shadowy disappearance.</p>
<p>The flight for liberty had begun. Would it succeed
or fail?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>
<h3>THE CAVES UNDER THE MOUNTAIN</h3>
</div>
<p>For a distance of five hundred feet the way was
known to both Larry and his sailor friend, and the
pair passed along swiftly, guided in part by the flickering
rays from the camp-fire outside of the main
cave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have a care now, lad,&rdquo; whispered Leroy, as
they reached a narrow passage, which turned first
to the left and then upward. &ldquo;The roof is low,
and you don&rsquo;t want for to dash your brains out
on the rocks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never fear but I&rsquo;ll be as careful as I can,&rdquo;
responded the youth, feeling his way along. &ldquo;Better
keep close, Leroy, that we don&rsquo;t become separated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The turn made, it was no easy matter to ascend
the sloping floor, with here and there a rough
bowlder to cross, or a hollow in which one might
fall and break a leg without half trying, as the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
<i>Yorktown</i> sailor said. Presently Leroy called a
halt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better light the torch now, Larry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was going to save it,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;There
is no telling how long we may have to depend
upon it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is true; but it&rsquo;s no longer safe to walk
in this pitchy darkness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leroy was provided with matches, used in smoking
his pipe, which had not been denied him, and
striking one he set fire to an end of the dry cedar
branch which Larry had laid away over a week
before, when the thought of running away had first
crossed his mind. At the start the branch spluttered
wofully and threatened to go out, but by
coaxing it remained lit, and presently burst into a
flame that was sufficient to see by for a circle of
twenty or thirty feet.</p>
<p>On they plodded, up an incline that seemed to
have no end, and then around another turn. Here
the chamber widened out, and beyond there were
branches, two to the left and one to the right.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;This is as far as I&rsquo;ve ever been,&rdquo; said the boy.
&ldquo;The passages beyond seemed to lead downward
for part of the way, and it&rsquo;s impossible to judge
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
which is the best to take. But I was of a mind to
try that one on the right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I reckon as how the right ought to be
right,&rdquo; laughed Leroy. &ldquo;If it ain&rsquo;t, all we can do
is to come back to here an&rsquo; try over again, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t got time to waste in experimenting,
Leroy. This is a serious business. We are liable
now to be shot on sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; nobody knows thet better nor Dan Leroy,
your humble servant. An&rsquo; if you say try one o&rsquo;
the other passages, I&rsquo;m jes&rsquo; as willin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we&rsquo;ll take that on the right,&rdquo; returned the
youth, and started onward without further delay.</p>
<p>The passage was a crooked one, not over ten
feet wide in any one part, and but little over the
height of a man. At one place a great rock blocked
the way, and over this they went on their hands and
knees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kind o&rsquo; a tight squeeze,&rdquo; remarked Leroy.
&ldquo;If that rock war a bit bigger, we wouldn&rsquo;t be
able to git over it at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hark!&rdquo; cried Larry, coming to a halt. &ldquo;What
is that, somebody calling?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They listened, and from a distance ahead made
out a low murmur of some kind. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s water
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
running over the rocks,&rdquo; cried Leroy. &ldquo;I hope
it&rsquo;s a river leading to the outer world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, so do I!&rdquo; ejaculated the boy, and both
started onward eagerly. Long before the fall of
water was gained they found themselves splashing
in an underground stream up to their ankles. The
waterfall was underground, coming from the rocks
overhead and running into the stream, which, in
turn, sank out of sight some distance further on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing in that,&rdquo; muttered Leroy, his face
falling.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, they stopped for a drink, for the
tramp through the caves had made them thirsty.
The old sailor held the torch, while Larry carried
the kettle. It was well that the top of the kettle
was on tight, otherwise the contents would have
been spilled long before this.</p>
<p>Beyond the waterfall the cave opened out once
more in fan shape, the roof running upward to
a high arch, from which hung stupendous stalactites
of white and brown. Here the water dripped
down in the form of a fine rain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re in a shower, lad, even though we are
underground,&rdquo; remarked Leroy. &ldquo;I must say I
hope this don&rsquo;t last. If it does, we&rsquo;ll soon be wet
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
to the skin.&rdquo; The vaulted cave soon came to an
end, however, and now they found themselves in
an opening cut up into a hundred different chambers,
like a coal mine supported by arches. Each
looked at the other in perplexity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can easily miss the way here,&rdquo; said Larry,
soberly. &ldquo;We had better lay out a course and
stick to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right you are, lad.&rdquo; Leroy pointed with his
hand. &ldquo;This seems as good a trail as any. Shall
we follow it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; And forward it was again. Presently
they came to another chamber, and here the slope
was again upward, much to their satisfaction. &ldquo;If
we keep on going upward, we are bound to get
out at the top, sometime,&rdquo; was the way Larry
calculated.</p>
<p>Climbing now became difficult, and in a number
of places each had to help the other along. Then
came a wall twelve feet high, and here they were
compelled to halt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks as if we were blocked,&rdquo; remarked the
<i>Yorktown</i> sailor after an examination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to give up yet,&rdquo; answered the
boy. &ldquo;If we can&rsquo;t get up any other way, we can
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
build a stairs with those loose stones we just
passed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah! you&rsquo;ve solved the difficulty!&rdquo; exclaimed
the old sailor, and they set to work with a will.
But rolling and lifting the stones into place was
no mean job, and when at last they were able to
pull themselves to the passageway above, both were
utterly worn out and glad enough to sit down.
The rest lasted longer than either had intended,
for Leroy, who had not slept well the night
before, dozed off, and Larry was not of a heart to
wake him up. So the boy went to sleep too, and
neither awakened until early morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo! what&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; cried Leroy, the first to
open his eyes. All was so dark about him&mdash;Larry
having extinguished the torch&mdash;that for the
minute he could not collect his senses. Putting
out his hand he touched the youth on the face,
and Larry awoke instantly.</p>
<p>They were both hungry, and lighting the torch
again, warmed up the kettle of stew, and then ate
about one-third of the stuff. &ldquo;Touches the spot,&rdquo;
cried Leroy, smacking his lips. He could have
eaten much more, but knew it was best to be careful
of their supply until the outer world was gained.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span></div>
<p>Much refreshed by their sleep, but somewhat
stiff from the dampness and the unaccustomed
work of the evening before, they proceed on their
way, still climbing upward and still in a darkness,
that was only partly dispelled by the feeble glare
of the torch, which was now growing alarmingly
small.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The light won&rsquo;t last more than a couple o&rsquo;
hours,&rdquo; said Leroy. &ldquo;Perhaps we had better split
the stick in two.&rdquo; This was done, and thus the
feeble light was reduced one-half.</p>
<p>Would the caves never come to an end? Such
was the question Larry asked himself over and
over again. Was it possible that they were to
journey so far only to find themselves trapped at
last? The thought made him shiver, and he
pushed on faster than ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know what I think?&rdquo; said Leroy, an
hour later. &ldquo;I think we are moving around in a
circle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A circle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, lad. Don&rsquo;t you notice how the passageway
keeps turning to the right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Larry had noticed it. &ldquo;But we are going
upward,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;True; but who knows but what we&rsquo;ll be going
downward presently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still they kept on, but now Larry&rsquo;s heart began
to fail him. They had progressed so far, had
made so many turns, that to get back would probably
be impossible. The caves were so vast one
might wander about in them forever&mdash;if one&rsquo;s
food did not give out. Larry shivered again and
clutched the precious kettle of stew tighter than
ever. He was once more hungry, but resolved to
wait until the pangs of hunger increased before
reducing the stock of food.</p>
<p>The passageway was now level for a considerable
distance, with here and there a rock to be
climbed over or a crack to cross. Both had just
made a leap over an opening several feet wide
when Leroy set up a shout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Larry, eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put the torch behind ye, lad, an&rsquo; look ahead.
Perhaps my eyes deceive me,&rdquo; answered the old sailor.</p>
<p>Larry did as requested, and gave a searching
look up the passageway. No, there was no mistaking
it&mdash;there was a faint glimmer of light
coming from what appeared to be a bend. He,
too, gave a shout, and both set off on a run.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span></div>
<p>As they sped onward the light became brighter
and brighter, until the torch was hardly needed.
They were running side by side, each trying to
gain the outer air first.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out!&rdquo; suddenly yelled Leroy, and caught
Larry by the arm. The old sailor could hardly
stop, and had to throw himself flat, dragging the
boy down on top of him.</p>
<p>A few feet beyond was an opening twelve to
fifteen feet wide, running from side to side of the
passageway. The walls of the opening were perpendicular,
and the hole was so deep that when a
stone was dropped into it they could scarcely hear
the thing strike bottom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a how-d&rsquo;ye-do!&rdquo; cried Leroy, gazing
into the pit. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t jump across that, nohow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A real good jumper might,&rdquo; answered Larry.
&ldquo;But I shouldn&rsquo;t want to try it. The other side
seems to slope down toward the hole. What&rsquo;s to
be done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ah, that was the question. It looked as if their
advance in that direction was cut off completely.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>
<h3>BOXER THE SCOUT</h3>
</div>
<p>Much chagrined, man and boy stood on the
brink of the chasm before them and gazed at the
other side. It was sloping, as Larry had said, and
wet, which was worse. A jump, even for a trained
athlete, would have been perilous in the extreme.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like we were stumped,&rdquo; remarked Leroy,
laconically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And just as we were so near to yonder opening!&rdquo;
cried Larry, vexed beyond endurance. &ldquo;If
we only had a plank, or something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked around, but nothing was at hand but
the bare stone walls, with here and there a patch of
dirt and a loose stone. He walked to one end of
the hole.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fellow might climb along yonder shelf if he
were a cat,&rdquo; he said dismally. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t believe
a human being could do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, and don&rsquo;t you go for to try it,&rdquo; put in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
old sailor. &ldquo;If you do, you&rsquo;ll break your neck, sure
as guns is guns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ve got to do something, Leroy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So we have; an&rsquo; I move we sit down an&rsquo; eat a
bite o&rsquo; the stew. Maybe eatin&rsquo; will put some new
ideas into our heads.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather wait until we gain the open air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we can&rsquo;t make it&mdash;yet&mdash;so be content, lad.
It&rsquo;s something to know thet the blue sky is beyond.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They sat down, and soon finished one-half of
what remained of the mess in the kettle. Never
had anything tasted sweeter, and it was only by
the exercise of the greatest self-control that they
kept back a portion of the food.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we&rsquo;ll have to go back, remember that,&rdquo;
said Leroy, as he put the cover on the kettle once
more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go back? No, no, Leroy! I&rsquo;ll try jumping
over first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I shall. Thet hole&mdash; What&rsquo;s
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A sound had reached the old sailor&rsquo;s ears, coming
from some distance ahead. It was the sound
of footsteps approaching.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody is coming!&rdquo; whispered Larry, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
crouched down. Then a man put in an appearance,
coming from the opposite end of the passageway.
He was an American soldier, hatless and
almost in tatters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo there!&rdquo; cried Larry, leaping up. &ldquo;Oh,
but I&rsquo;m glad you came!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the cry the soldier stopped short in amazement.
Larry&rsquo;s words echoed and re&euml;choed throughout
the passage. He looked toward the pair at the
chasm, but could make out little saving the torch
which Leroy was holding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who calls?&rdquo; he asked at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I called,&rdquo; answered the boy. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you see
us? We are two lost sailors, and we can&rsquo;t get
over this beastly hole. Come this way, but be
careful of where you step.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must be Americans by your voices. Am
I right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; and you are an American, too,&rdquo; said
Larry, as the soldier came closer. Soon he stood
facing them, with a look of wonder on his bronzed
features.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you get here?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a long story,&rdquo; answered Leroy. &ldquo;We escaped
from some rebels at the other end of this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
cave, and we&rsquo;ve been wandering around since last
night. Are you alone, or are our forces outside
of this hole?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;General Lawton&rsquo;s troops are a good many miles
from here,&rdquo; answered the soldier. &ldquo;I am one of
his scouts, and I became separated from our command
and got up here to escape being hunted
down by the crowd of Filipinos that was after
me. They are in the woods just outside of this
hole.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you are all alone?&rdquo; said Larry, his face
falling a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, although I think a couple of our men
must be in this vicinity. We are pressing the
rebels pretty hard, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The scout&rsquo;s name was George Boxer, and he
was one of the best marksmen in Chief Young&rsquo;s
command. He listened to their story with interest,
and at once agreed to do what he could for
them. They noted with satisfaction that he was
provided with both a rifle and a pistol, and also
a belt well filled with ammunition.</p>
<p>It was an easy matter for Boxer to make his
way into the open air and find a fallen tree limb
of sufficient thickness to throw over the chasm
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
as a make-shift bridge. As soon as the limb was
secure, Larry and Leroy came over, and then the
party of three made their way to the mouth of
the cave.</p>
<p>It was a welcome sight to see the sky again
and the sunshine, and Larry&rsquo;s eyes sparkled as
he gazed down the mountain-side and at the vast
panorama spread out before him. At their feet
was a heavy jungle, and beyond a plain and a
small hill, where a large body of insurgents were
encamping.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good to be in the fresh air again, eh,
lad?&rdquo; observed Leroy. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m afraid we&rsquo;ll
have a good bit o&rsquo; trouble gettin&rsquo; past them
rebels,&rdquo; he added to George Boxer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t get past them in the daytime,&rdquo;
answered the scout; &ldquo;but I think we can make
it after the sun goes down. And it will take us
till sundown to get to the bottom of this mountain,
if I am not mistaken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now they were in the open, it was decided to
discard the kettle; and the three ate up what
remained of the stew, along with the single ration
which Boxer carried. Then they began the descent
of the mountain-side, slipping over rocks
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
and dirt as best they could, and finding their
way around many an ugly pitfall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you think it&rsquo;s queer I came up
so far,&rdquo; said Boxer, as they hurried downward.
&ldquo;The truth is I was so closely pursued I didn&rsquo;t
realize how far I was going. Those rebels can
climb the mountains like so many wildcats. I&rsquo;m
afraid we&rsquo;ll never clean them out if they take
a stand up here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was hot, and now Leroy gazed from time to
time at the sky. &ldquo;A storm or something is coming,&rdquo;
he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, something is coming,&rdquo; added Boxer. &ldquo;I
can tell it by the way the birds are flying about.
They seem to be troubled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see a cloud away off to the southward,&rdquo;
put in Larry. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not large, but it&rsquo;s mighty
black.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No more was said just then upon the subject;
and they continued their journey down the mountain-side
until they came to a fair-sized stream,
where they quenched their thirst and took a
wash. They were about to go on again when
Boxer held up his hand as a warning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great gophers, boys, we are running right into
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
a nest of the rebels!&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Back with
you, before it is too late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They looked ahead and saw that the scout was
right. They started to go back; and as they
turned, a Mauser rang out and a bullet clipped
the bushes beside them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Discovered!&rdquo; came from Leroy&rsquo;s lips. &ldquo;Larry,
I&rsquo;m afraid the jig is up. Those Filipi&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Crack! It was Boxer&rsquo;s rifle that rang out, and
as the scout was a sharpshooter, it may be taken
for granted that he brought down his man. Then
the three set off on a run along the side of the
mountain to where a slight rise of ground promised
better hiding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t do much against such a crowd,&rdquo; said
the scout. &ldquo;But in a good spot we can hold out
awhile, provided one of you can use my pistol.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can fire tolerably straight,&rdquo; answered Leroy,
and took the weapon. Soon the rise was gained,
and they plunged in behind a tangle of pines.
The Filipinos were following them, although taking
good care not to expose themselves needlessly
to the fire of such a crack marksman as Boxer
had proved himself to be.</p>
<p>From behind the tangle of growth, the three
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
Americans watched the skilful advance of the
enemy with dismay. &ldquo;They are trying to surround
us!&rdquo; whispered Boxer. Then like a flash
his rifle went up. The report was followed by
a yell of pain, and a Filipino fell into view from
behind a tree less than fifty yards distant. The
poor fellow was hit in the side, but managed to
crawl back into cover again, groaning dismally.</p>
<p>Leroy also fired, a second later, aiming at a
tall Tagal who was crossing a clearing to their
left. If he hit his mark, the rebel gave no sign,
but the man disappeared in a great hurry. Then
came a crashing through the bushes below and
to the left, proving that the Filipinos were massing
in those directions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we had better try to crawl away from
this&mdash;&rdquo; began Larry, when a humming sound
caught his ear. At the same time the sky grew
black.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look! look!&rdquo; yelled Leroy. &ldquo;What is this&mdash;the
end of the world?&rdquo;</p>
<p>All looked up. The humming had increased to
a whistle, and now came a crashing of trees and
brush mingled with the wild cries of the Filipinos
as they rushed away toward a near-by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
mountain stream. They knew what was coming,
even if our friends did not.</p>
<p>And then the tornado was almost upon them.
I say almost, for, thanks to an all-ruling Providence,
it did not strike them fairly, but rushed
to one side, where the Filipinos had been gathering.
The light of day seemed to die out utterly,
and the air was filled with flying d&eacute;bris and
screaming birds and wild animals made homeless
on the instant. The very earth seemed to quake
with the violence of the trees uprooted, and
branches and dirt flew all over the Americans,
until they were buried as completely as Ben and his
companions had been. Larry thought it was indeed
the end of the world, and breathed a silent prayer
that God might watch over him and those he loved.</p>
<p>At last the rushing wind ceased, and the crashing
was lost in the distance. But the birds kept up
their wild cries, and for several seconds neither
Larry nor those with him moved, wondering if that
was the end of the tornado, or if worse was to
follow. But it was the end, and gradually they
came forth one after another, to gaze on the mighty
wreckage about them. It was Leroy who raised his
hand solemnly to heaven.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I thank God that we have been spared,&rdquo; he said,
and Larry and the scout uttered an amen.</p>
<p>Whether or not to leave the vicinity was a question.
At last, seeing no more of the enemy, they
plucked up courage enough to move down the
mountain-side once more. But the tornado had
made the passage more difficult than ever, and several
times they had to turn back. Nightfall found
them still some distance from the plain, with yet
another jungle to pass before the open would be
gained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might as well make a night of it here,&rdquo; said
Boxer, and footsore and weary Larry and Leroy
agreed with him. It was not long before all
dropped asleep, too tired to stand guard, and hardly
deeming that one was necessary.</p>
<p>The tornado had killed numerous birds and small
animals, and it was easy to pick up a plentiful
breakfast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about making a fire,&rdquo; said Leroy.
&ldquo;Those rebels may spot us before we are aware.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet they were too hungry to go without eating,
and in the end they built a fire of the driest wood
they could find, and while Boxer cooked the birds,
Larry and the old sailor scattered the smoke with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
their jackets, so that it might not go up in a cloud,
and also kept their eyes open for the possible
appearance of the rebels. But the tornado had
scared the insurgents as much as it had anybody,
and not one showed himself.</p>
<p>By eight o&rsquo;clock they were once more on the
way, Boxer leading with his gun ready for use,
Larry in the centre, and Leroy bringing up the rear
with the pistol.</p>
<p>They were just entering the jungle at the foot
of the mountain when a strange moaning reached
their ears and all halted. There was a silence, and
then the moaning started up again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; questioned Larry. &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be
a human being.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I know what it is,&rdquo; returned the scout.
&ldquo;Wait here till I make sure,&rdquo; and he glided ahead
and was soon lost to sight under a clump of tall
trees which grew in somewhat of a clearing. Soon
they heard him shouting for them to come on.</p>
<p>It was a water buffalo that was moaning. The
beast had become caught under a partly fallen tree
and could not release itself. It was a handsome
animal and weighed a good many hundred pounds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s meat and to spare!&rdquo; cried Boxer, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
drawing forth a hunting knife, he put the caribao
out of his misery in short order. &ldquo;This is some
more work of that tornado,&rdquo; he went on, as he proceeded
to cut out a choice steak. &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t starve
for the next forty-eight hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope by that time we&rsquo;ll have reached the
army,&rdquo; answered Larry, and took the portion of
meat handed to him. It was not a dainty thing to
carry, but he had to shoulder it, since Boxer and
Leroy were carrying the weapons.</p>
<p>As they proceeded, the jungle appeared to become
more dense, until it was next to impossible to make
any progress. Yet they felt that each step was
bringing them closer to the open plain and to a
point where few natives were likely to be congregated.
&ldquo;If we once get down to the bottom, we&rsquo;ll
be all right,&rdquo; said Boxer.</p>
<p>But the scout had not reckoned on the fact that
there was a hollow at the base of the mountain, and
that the heavy rains had filled this full to overflowing.
It was Larry who first called attention to the
fact that the ground was growing damp. Then of
a sudden the whole party stepped into the water up
to their ankles.</p>
<p>Here was a new dilemma to face, and each looked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span>
at the others in anything but a happy mood.
&ldquo;Beats everything what luck we&rsquo;re having!&rdquo; cried
Leroy, in deep disgust. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d give a year&rsquo;s pay to
be safe on board the <i>Yorktown</i> agin, keelhaul me if
I wouldn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose the best thing we can do is to march
around the swamp-hole,&rdquo; replied Larry. &ldquo;What do
you say, Boxer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us try it a bit further,&rdquo; replied the scout,
and they moved forward with care. At first the
ground appeared to grow better, but then they went
down again halfway to their knees and in a muck
that stuck to them like glue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use, we&rsquo;ll have to go back,&rdquo; groaned
Leroy, and turned about. Silently the others followed
him, wondering where the adventure would
end.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>
<h3>THE DEPARTURE OF THE <i>OLYMPIA</i></h3>
</div>
<p>The advances of both General MacArthur and
General Lawton had been so far nothing but a series
of successes, and so hard were the insurgents pressed,
that they scarcely knew what to do next. Again
they sued for peace, but as the Americans were not
inclined to grant them anything until they had surrendered
unconditionally, the war went on, but in
more of a guerilla-fight fashion than ever.</p>
<p>Near San Fernando the rebels continued to tear
up the railroad tracks, and likewise attacked a train
of supplies, killing and wounding several who were
on board. They also attacked several gunboats
coming up the San Fernando River, keeping themselves
safely hidden, in the meantime, behind high
embankments thrown up along the stream. While
this was going on General Aguinaldo called a council
of war, at San Isidro, at which fifty-six of his main
followers were present. By a vote it was found
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
that twenty were for peace, twenty for war, and
sixteen wished to negotiate with the United States
for better terms. This gathering gave rise to a
rumor that the war would terminate inside of forty-eight
hours. Alas! it was still to drag on for many
months to come.</p>
<p>The day after the tornado found Ben safe in camp
again, with Gilbert in the hospital receiving every
attention. It was Sunday, and a day of rest for the
majority of the troops. At a small tent a short
service was held, and Ben walked over, to hear a
very good sermon on man&rsquo;s duty toward God under
any and all circumstances. The sermon was followed
by the singing of several hymns, and the
soldiers remained at the spot for an hour or more
afterward, talking over the general situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It always takes me back home to hear the
preachin&rsquo;,&rdquo; remarked Ralph Sorrel. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m mighty
glad we have it. It shows we ain&rsquo;t no heathens,
even though we air livin&rsquo; a kind o&rsquo; hit-an&rsquo;-miss life
a-followin&rsquo; up these yere rebs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Monday the scouts went out to the front, and
a small brush was had with a number of the insurgents
in the vicinity of San Miguel de Mayumo.
They reported that the Filipinos had a number of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
intrenchments placed across the roads, but seemed to
be retreating toward San Isidro.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Aguinaldo makes a stand anywhere, it will be
at San Isidro,&rdquo; said Ben to Major Morris, as the two
discussed the situation. &ldquo;Oh, but I do wish we
could have one big battle and finish this campaign!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about the big battle going against us?&rdquo;
demanded the major, but with a twinkle in his
eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would never go against us,&rdquo; answered the
young captain, promptly, &ldquo;and the insurgents
know it. That is why they keep their distance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The scouts had brought in a dozen or more prisoners,
and among them were a Filipino and a
Spaniard, both of whom could speak English quite
fluently. As soon as he could obtain permission,
Ben hurried over to have a talk with the prisoners.</p>
<p>He found that the Filipino had belonged to those
having some of the American prisoners in charge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you know anything of my brother?&rdquo;
he asked eagerly. &ldquo;He is a young sailor from the
<i>Olympia</i>, and his name is Larry Russell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, I know him,&rdquo; answered the Filipino,
nodding his head. &ldquo;He was at the cave where they
have kept some of the prisoners for a long time.&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
And he described Larry so minutely that Ben felt
there could be no mistake about the matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is my brother well? How do they treat him?
Please tell me the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may not believe it, but we treat our prisoners
good,&rdquo; said the Filipino. &ldquo;And when I saw
your brother last he was very well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where is this prison cave?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this the insurgent shrugged his shoulder.
&ldquo;Now, <i>capitan</i>, you are asking me too much. I am
pleased to tell you that your brother is safe. More
than that I cannot tell, for it would not be right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was not encouraging, yet Ben could not help
but admire the prisoner&rsquo;s loyalty to his cause.
&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I am thankful to know
that my brother is well. I was afraid that prison
life might make him sick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A little later the young captain got the chance
to talk to the Spanish prisoner, who was making
an application for his release, claiming that he was
friendly to the United States and had never encouraged
the rebels. Seldom had the young captain met
more of a gentleman than Se&ntilde;or Romano proved
to be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, the war is terrible! terrible!&rdquo; said the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
se&ntilde;or, after Ben had introduced himself. &ldquo;It is
bloodshed, bloodshed, all the time. Where it will
end, Heaven alone knows&mdash;but I am afraid the
Filipinos will be beaten far worse than was my own
country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you are right there,&rdquo; replied Ben. &ldquo;But
we can&rsquo;t do anything for them now until they lay
down their arms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The war has ruined hundreds of planters and
merchants,&mdash;whole fortunes have been swept away,&mdash;and
the insurgents have levied taxes which are
beyond endurance. To some, Aguinaldo is their
idol, but to me he is a base schemer who wants
everything, and only for his own glory. But he
cannot hold out much longer,&mdash;you are pressing him
into the very mountains,&mdash;and once away from the
civilization of the towns, his followers will become
nothing but <i>banditti</i>&mdash;mark me if it is not so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a resident of Luzon?&rdquo; went on Ben.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hardly. I belong in Spain&mdash;but I have lived
here for several years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know one Benedicto Lupez, or his
brother Jos&eacute;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this question the brow of Se&ntilde;or Romano
darkened.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Do I know them? Ah, yes, I know them only
too well. They are rascals, villains, cheats of the
worst order. I trust they are not your friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hardly, although I should like first-rate to
meet them, and especially to meet Benedicto.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And for what? Excuse my curiosity, but what
can an American captain and gentleman like you
have in common with Benedicto Lupez?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to get hold of some bank money that
he carried off,&rdquo; answered the young captain, and
told the story of the missing funds and the part
the Spaniard was supposed to have played in their
disappearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is like Lupez,&rdquo; answered Se&ntilde;or Romano.
&ldquo;He is wanted in Cuba for having swindled a
rich aunt out of a small fortune; and in Manila
you will find a hundred people who will tell you
that both brothers are rascals to the last degree,
although, so far, they have kept out of the clutches
of the law&mdash;through bribery, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not during General Otis&rsquo;s term of office?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; before the city fell into your hands. The
government was very corrupt and winked at Lupez&rsquo;s
doings so long as he divided with certain
officials.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;And what did he work at?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Land schemes and loan companies. He once
got me interested in a land scheme, and his rascality
cost me many dollars, and I came pretty
near to going to prison in the bargain.&rdquo; Se&ntilde;or
Romano paused a moment. &ldquo;If your troops take
San Isidro, you will have a good chance to catch
both of the brothers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! do you mean to say they are at San
Isidro?&rdquo; exclaimed the young captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are, or, at least, they were two or three
days ago. How long they will stay there, I cannot
say. They were at the council of war held
by Aguinaldo&rsquo;s followers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see.&rdquo; Ben mused for a moment. &ldquo;Of
course you do not know if they had the stolen
money with them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They appeared to have some money, for both
were offered positions in the army, and that would
not have happened had not they had funds to
buy the offices with. They appeared to be very
thick with a general named Porlar,&mdash;a tricky
fellow of French-Malay blood. I believe the three
had some scheme they wished to put through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;d like to catch the pair. I wonder
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span>
if Aguinaldo would keep them around him, if he
knew their real characters?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this Se&ntilde;or Romano laughed outright. &ldquo;You
do not know how bad are some of the men around
the arch rebel, <i>capitan</i>. He has some bad advisers,
I can tell you that. To some of the worst
of the crowd, Aguinaldo is but a figurehead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pair discussed the matter for half an hour;
and during that time Ben became convinced that
Se&ntilde;or Romano had small sympathy for the insurgents,
and was certainly not of their number.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will do what I can for you, se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; he said,
on parting. &ldquo;I do not believe you will be kept
a prisoner long.&rdquo; And the young captain was
right on this score; the Spanish gentleman was
released inside of forty-eight hours, and journeyed
to Manila in company with a detachment bound
for the capital of Luzon.</p>
<p>The two talks made Ben do a good deal of
sober thinking. He now knew to a certainty that
Larry was alive and well, and he knew also that
Benedicto Lupez was at or near San Isidro, and
more than likely had the stolen money on his
person. &ldquo;I wish we could push ahead without
delay,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;I might make a splendid
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span>
strike all around. I know Larry is just aching
to be at liberty once more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But supplies were again slow in coming to the
front, and General Lawton did not feel like risking
his men when the Filipinos might surrender at
any moment. So a delay of several days occurred,
with only a little skirmish here and there to
break the monotony.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo, here&rsquo;s news!&rdquo; cried Major Morris, as
he rushed up to Ben&rsquo;s quarters one morning.
&ldquo;Dewey is going to sail for the United States.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the <i>Olympia</i>?&rdquo; queried the young captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. The warship leaves next Saturday, with
all on board. Won&rsquo;t he get a rousing reception
when he arrives home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Larry won&rsquo;t be with him,&rdquo; said Ben.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Jove, captain, that&rsquo;s so. It&rsquo;s too bad, isn&rsquo;t
it? I suppose he would like to go, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say as to that. Perhaps he would just
as lief stay here and join some command on land,
or some other ship, especially if he knew that my
brother Walter was coming on. But I am sure
he would like to see his old messmates off,&rdquo; concluded
Ben.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span></div>
<p>Admiral Dewey started for the United States
at four o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon of Saturday, May
20. The departure proved a gala time, the harbor
and shipping being decorated, and the other warships
firing a salute. The bands played &ldquo;Auld
Lang Syne,&rdquo; &ldquo;Home, Sweet Home,&rdquo; and &ldquo;America,&rdquo;
and the jackies crowded the tops to get a
last look at the noble flagship as she slipped down
the bay toward the China Sea, with the admiral
standing on the bridge, hat in hand, and waving
them a final adieu. In all the time he had
been at Manila, Admiral Dewey had served his
country well, and his home-coming was indeed to
be one of grand triumph.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>
<h3>THE ADVANCE UPON SAN ISIDRO</h3>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Luke Striker, is it possible! I thought
you had sailed for the United States on the
<i>Olympia</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, ye hadn&rsquo;t no right to think that, captain,&rdquo;
responded the old gunner, as he shook
hands warmly. &ldquo;It might be that the others
could go away and leave Larry behind, but he&rsquo;s
too much my boy for me to do that&mdash;yes, sirree.
When I hears as we were to set sail for the States,
I goes up to the admiral himself, an&rsquo; says I:
&lsquo;Admiral,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;do you remember how Larry
Russell an&rsquo; yer humble servant comes on board of
the <i>Olympia</i>?&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; says he. &lsquo;I remember
it well,&rsquo; says he. &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;Larry is
ashore, a prisoner of the enemy,&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t
want to go for to leave him, nohow. Can&rsquo;t you
leave me behind,&rsquo; says I. And he laughs and
asks me all about Larry, and finally says I can
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
go ashore and report to Rear Admiral Watson&mdash;who
is comin&rsquo; on&mdash;sometime later. And here I
am, come to the front, to find Larry, ef sech a
thing is possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old sailor&rsquo;s honest speech went straight to
Ben&rsquo;s heart, and he saw very plainly how deep
was Luke&rsquo;s affection for his younger brother.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a messmate worth having, Luke!&rdquo; he
exclaimed. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wonder Larry thought so
much of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Avast, I&rsquo;m only a common sea-dog at the best,
captain,&mdash;an ef I remained behind to cast around
fer the lad, ye mustn&rsquo;t think thet Jack Biddle an&rsquo;
the others have forgotten Larry, fer they ain&rsquo;t, not
by a jugful. Every man jack o&rsquo; them is his friend,
an&rsquo; was, almost from the start.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Luke had come up to the camp by way of
Malolos, accompanying a pack-train of caribao
carts carrying rations and army equipments. He
had left the <i>Olympia</i> several days before, and had
not waited to witness the departure of the flagship.</p>
<p>As Luke wished to remain with Ben, the latter
lost no time in presenting the matter to Colonel
Darcy and to Major Morris, and Luke was taken
into the regiment camp as a cook, for he had once
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span>
been a cook on a merchantman, years before. The
position was largely an honorary one, and the
sailor was permitted to leave his pots and kettles
whenever he pleased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good news,&rdquo; he said, when the young captain
had told him what the prisoners had said
about Larry and Benedicto Lupez. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve an idee
we&rsquo;ll get to Larry soon, an&rsquo; down thet tarnal Spaniard
in the bargain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The conversation took place on Tuesday. On
Wednesday orders came to strike camp, and the
march of the regiment was taken toward San
Isidro by way of Baluarte, a small village seven
miles to the southeast of the new rebel capital.
In the meantime, although the Americans were
not aware of it, Aguinaldo was preparing to decamp,
with his so-called congress, into the mountain
fastnesses, still further northward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are in for another fight,&rdquo; said Major
Morris, as he came to Ben that afternoon. &ldquo;And
I&rsquo;ve an idea it is going to be something to the
finish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That means, then, that we are bound for San
Isidro!&rdquo; cried the young captain. &ldquo;Hurrah!
that&rsquo;s the best news I&rsquo;ve heard in a week.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span></div>
<p>The regiment was soon on the road, spread out
in proper battalion form. The day was close, and
it looked as if a thunderstorm was at hand. The
growth along the road was thick, and at certain
points the overhanging branches had to be cut off
that the troops might pass. The trail was bad,
and often a gun, or wagon, had to stop so that a
hole might be bridged over with bamboo poles.
Here and there they passed a nipa hut, but these
places were deserted, excepting in rare instances,
where an aged native would stand at the door,
holding up a white rag as a signal of surrender,
or to show that he was an <i>amigo</i>, or friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s pitiable,&rdquo; said Ben to Major Morris, as
they trudged along side by side. &ldquo;I reckon some
of these ignorant creatures have an idea that we
have come to annihilate them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can be sure that Aguinaldo and his followers
have taught them something like that,&rdquo;
replied the major. &ldquo;Otherwise, they wouldn&rsquo;t look
so terrified.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At one point in the road, they came to a tumble-down
hut, at the doorway of which rested a woman
and her three small children, all watching the soldiers
with eyes full of terror. Going up to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span>
woman, Ben spoke kindly to her, but she immediately
fled into the dilapidated structure, dragging
her trio of offspring after her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t make friends that way,&rdquo; cried Major
Morris. &ldquo;They won&rsquo;t trust you. I&rsquo;ve tried it more
than once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was now a hill to climb, thick with tropical
trees and brush. The regiment had scarcely
covered a hundred feet of the ascent, when there
came a volley of shots from a ridge beyond, which
wounded two soldiers in the front rank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The rebels are in sight!&rdquo; was the cry. &ldquo;Come
on, boys, let us drive &rsquo;em back! On to San Isidro!&rdquo;
And away went one battalion after another,
fatigued by a two miles&rsquo; tramp, but eager to engage
once more in the fray. It was found that the insurgents
had the ridge well fortified, and General
Lawton at once spread out his troops in a semicircle,
in the hope of surrounding the ridge and
cutting off the defenders from the main body of
Aguinaldo&rsquo;s army.</p>
<p>Ben&rsquo;s regiment was coming, &ldquo;head on,&rdquo; for the
top of the ridge. The way was over ground much
broken by tree-stumps, rocks, and entangling vines,
that brought many a soldier flat.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s a rigular fish-net!&rdquo; spluttered
Dan Casey, as he tried in vain to rise, with vines
ensnaring both arms and legs. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know but
phwat a fellow wants a wire-cutter here, just as they
had &rsquo;em in Cuby to cut the wire finces wid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nefer mind, so long as we got by der dop of
dot hill,&rdquo; answered Carl Stummer, as he hauled his
mate out of the entanglement. &ldquo;Be dankful dot
you ain&rsquo;t parefooted by dem dorns.&rdquo; And on went
both once more. There was many a slip and a
tumble, but very little grumbling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down!&rdquo; The cry came from the front, and
down went Ben&rsquo;s company into a little hollow,
for the rebels had them in plain view now, and
the two lines were less than three hundred yards
apart. A volley from the insurgents followed,
but nobody was struck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forward twenty-five yards!&rdquo; cried Ben, and
up went the company for another dash. It was
a soul-trying moment, and none felt it more than
the young commander, who ran on ahead to inspire
his men. He knew that at any instant a
bullet might hit him to lay him low forever. But
his &ldquo;baptism of fire&rdquo; had been complete, and he
did not flinch.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Hot work, this!&rdquo; The words came from Gilmore
as he came up the hill close to Ben. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
going to be no picnic taking that ridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True, Gilmore; but it&rsquo;s got to be done,&rdquo;
answered the young commander. &ldquo;Down!&rdquo; he
shouted, and again the company fell flat. Then
began a firing at will, which lasted the best part
of ten minutes. The insurgents, likewise, fired,
and a corporal and a private were wounded and
had to be carried to the rear.</p>
<p>Looking around, Ben espied Luke Striker in the
ranks of Company D. The old sailor had provided
himself with a rifle and an ammunition belt,
and was popping away at a lively rate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t help it,&rdquo; said Luke, when the young
captain came up to him. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the best fun I&rsquo;ve
had sence thet air muss in Manila Bay, when we
blowed old Montojo out o&rsquo; the water, off Cavite.
Say, but we&rsquo;ll git to the top o&rsquo; the hill afore
long, jes&rsquo; see ef we don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; And Luke blazed
away again, and so Ben left him.</p>
<p>The rest of the battalion was now closing in,
and soon another advance was made, until the
first line of the American troops was less than
a hundred and fifty yards away from the insurgents&rsquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span>
outer intrenchments. Then a yell came
from a jungle on the left.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that? more rebels?&rdquo; cried Ben, and
listened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, the Filipinos are retreating!&rdquo; came
from a score of throats. &ldquo;See, they are scattering
like sheep! Up the hill, fellows; the fight
is ours!&rdquo; And a regular stampede occurred, each
command trying to get to the top of the ridge
first. The rebels were indeed retreating into a
thicket behind the ridge. They went less than
half a mile, however, and then made another
stand, this time on the upper side of a mountain
stream,&mdash;the very stream at which Larry and his
companions had stopped after the escape from the
caves under the mountain.</p>
<p>To ford the stream would have been an easy
matter under ordinary circumstances, but with the
rebels guarding the upper bank, it was extremely
hazardous, and the regiment came to a halt on
the edge of the brush overhanging the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are straight ahead, boys,&rdquo; said Major
Morris, after his scouts had reported to him.
&ldquo;We will make a detour to the right. Forward,
and on the double-quick!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span></div>
<p>Every soldier felt that delay would mean a
serious loss, and a rapid rush was made through
the jungle to a point where the stream became
rocky and winding. Here an excellent ford was
found, and they went over in column of fours.
They could now enfilade the rebels&rsquo; position, and
this they did so disastrously that the Filipinos
speedily threw down a large part of their arms
and fled helter-skelter into the mountain fastnesses
still further to the northward.</p>
<p>The battle over, the battalion came to rest
under the shade of the trees lining the stream,
many of the soldiers throwing themselves down
in a state bordering upon exhaustion, for the
humidity in the air told upon them greatly.
There was not a breath of a breeze, and the
water hardly quenched the thirst that raged
within them. As Major Morris declared, &lsquo;It
was the primest place to catch a fever in&rsquo; he
had ever seen.</p>
<p>Ben was sitting at the foot of a tall tree talking
to Gilmore, when he saw the advance guards
bringing in two Americans, one evidently a sailor.
At once he sprang to meet the sailor, thinking
the man might know something about Larry.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span></div>
<p>The two men proved to be Dan Leroy and
Boxer, the scout, and when he mentioned his
brother&rsquo;s name to them, both were of course
astonished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do we know him!&rdquo; cried Leroy. &ldquo;Sure and
didn&rsquo;t he and I run away together from the
rebels, and Boxer, here, helping us to get out of
the prison caves. Yes, yes, I know Larry well.&rdquo;
And then Leroy told of the escape from the caves,
and of how all three of the party had become
lost in the swamp lands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were in the swamps two days, and thought
we would never get out,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;Luckily,
we had some caribao meat with us; otherwise
we should have starved to death. The swamps
were full of mosquitoes and lizards and lots of
other things, and we were almost eaten up alive,
eh, Boxer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So we were,&rdquo; replied the scout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what of my brother?&rdquo; asked Ben, impatiently.</p>
<p>At this the faces of both of the men fell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t say what became o&rsquo; him,&rdquo; said the
sailor from the <i>Yorktown</i>. &ldquo;You see, after we
got out of the swamp, we determined to stick to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
the high ground until we found a regular trail
leading to the south. Well, our walk took us
up to a high cliff overlooking a gorge filled with
trees and bushes. We were walking ahead, with
Larry at our heels, as we thought, when Boxer
chanced to look around, and the boy was gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone!&rdquo; gasped Ben, in horror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, gone! We couldn&rsquo;t understand it, and
called to him, but he didn&rsquo;t answer. Then we
went back about quarter of a mile, past the spot
where we had seen him last, and fired the pistol
as a signal. But he had disappeared totally, and
we couldn&rsquo;t find hide nor hair o&rsquo; him, try our
level best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The confession was a sickening one, and for
several minutes Ben could not trust himself to
speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And&mdash;and what do you think became of
my brother?&rdquo; he asked, at length.</p>
<p>Both men shrugged their shoulders. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid
he fell over the cliff,&rdquo; said Boxer. &ldquo;You see, the
footpath was narrow and mighty slippery in spots.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At once Ben&rsquo;s mind went back to that scene in
far-away Cuba, when Gerald Holgait had fallen
over a cliff. Had a similar fate overtaken his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span>
brother? and if so, was he still alive or had he
been dashed to his death?</p>
<p>&ldquo;How far is that spot from here?&rdquo; he demanded
abruptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not over a mile, cap&rsquo;n,&rdquo; answered Boxer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see you are a scout. Can you take me to
the place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly&mdash;but&mdash;but&mdash;it&rsquo;s mighty risky, cap&rsquo;n&mdash;so
many rebs lurking about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind&mdash;I must find Larry, alive or dead.
Take me to him, and I&rsquo;ll pay you well for your
services.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t asking a cent, cap&rsquo;n&mdash;that ain&rsquo;t my
style.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you will take me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; said Boxer, promptly. &ldquo;Only I&rsquo;ll
have to report first and get official permission.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Major Morris will arrange that for you, I feel
certain,&rdquo; answered Ben, turning to the major, who
sat near, drinking in the conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll arrange that,&rdquo; said the major. &ldquo;But
I don&rsquo;t see how I am going to do without you,
captain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you keep me from looking for my
brother?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, go ahead, and Gilmore can take the
company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So it was arranged; and inside of quarter of an
hour Ben and Boxer were ready to depart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain, can&rsquo;t I go with ye?&rdquo; It was Luke
Striker who asked the question. The anxious look
on his face spoke more eloquently than words, and
Ben consented without argument.</p>
<p>And so the three set off on the search for Larry,
little dreaming of the strange happenings in store
for them.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>
<h3>LARRY IS SENTENCED TO BE SHOT</h3>
</div>
<p>To go back to Larry, at the time mentioned by
Dan Leroy, when the boy had been following the
old sailor and the scout along the cliff overlooking
the valley in which both the Filipino and the
American troops were encamped.</p>
<p>The adventures in the swamp had been exceedingly
tiring, and the youth could scarcely drag
one foot after the other, as the party of three
hurried along over rocks and through thickets
which at certain points seemed almost impassible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O dear! I&rsquo;ll be glad when this day&rsquo;s tramp
comes to an end,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;I wonder how far
the American camp is from here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He tried to look across the valley, but there was
a bluish vapor hanging over trees and brush which
shut off a larger portion of the view. The party
had been walking over a trail which now brought
them directly to the edge of the cliff. Here the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
footpath was scarcely two feet wide, and was backed
up by high rocks and thorn bushes, around which
it was difficult to climb without injury.</p>
<p>The men were as tired as the boy, and it must
be confessed that for a half hour or more they
paid little attention to Larry. Gradually the
youth lagged behind, until those ahead were lost
to view around a sharp turn of the cliff.</p>
<p>And it was then that an accident happened
which put Larry in great peril all in an instant.
In trying to make the turn, the boy got hold of a
slender tree by which to support himself. Leroy
and Boxer had grasped the same tree, and their
swinging around had loosened its frail hold on
the rocks, and as Larry grasped it, down went
the sapling over the edge of the cliff, carrying the
youth with it.</p>
<div class='figtag'>
<a name='linki_9' id='linki_9'></a>
</div>
<div class='figcenter'>

<p class='caption'>
Down went the sapling over the edge of the cliff.&mdash;<i>Page 281.</i><br />
</p>
</div>
<p>The boy had no time to cry out, and he clung
fast, not knowing what else to do, until the tree
landed with a mighty crash on the top of another
tree at the foot of the cliff. The sudden stoppage
caused Larry to loose his hold, and he bumped
from limb to limb in the tree below until he struck
the ground with a dull thud; and then for the time
being he knew no more.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span></div>
<p>When the boy came to his senses, he found it
was night and pitch dark under the thick tree,
through the branches of which he had fallen. He
rested on a bed of soft moss, and this cushionlike
substance had most likely saved him from fatal
injury.</p>
<p>His first feeling was one of bewilderment, his
next that his left foot felt as if it was on fire,
with a shooting pain that ran well up to his knee.
Catching hold of the foot, he felt that the ankle
was much swollen, and that his shoe-top was ready
to burst with the pressure. Scarcely realizing what
he was doing, he loosened the shoe, at which part
of the pain left him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose I ought to be thankful that I wasn&rsquo;t
killed,&rdquo; he thought, rather dismally. &ldquo;I wonder
where Leroy and that scout are? I don&rsquo;t suppose
it will do any good to call for them. The top of
that cliff must be a hundred feet from here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fall had almost finished what was left of
Larry&rsquo;s already ragged suit, and he found himself
scratched in a dozen places, with a bad cut over
one eye and several splinters in his left hand.
Feeling in his pocket, he found several matches which
Leroy had given him on leaving the prison cave,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
and he lit one of these and set fire to a few dried
leaves which happened to be ready to hand.</p>
<p>The light afforded a little consolation, and by its
rays the boy made out a pool of water not far off,
and to this he dragged himself, to get a drink and
then bathe the ankle. This member of his body had
been so badly wrenched that standing upon it was
out of the question, as he speedily discovered by a
trial which made him scream with pain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in for it now,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;With such an
ankle as this, I can&rsquo;t go on, and what am I to do
here, alone in the woods and with absolutely nothing
to eat? I&rsquo;d be better off in a Filipino prison.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slowly the night wore along, until a faint light in
the east announced the coming of day. During the
darkness the jungle had been almost silent, but now
the birds began to tune up, and here and there
Larry heard the movements of small animals, although
none of the latter showed themselves.</p>
<p>It was more pleasant under the big tree than
down by the pool, and as daylight came on, Larry
dragged himself back to his first resting-place. As
he came up to the tree he saw a broken branch resting
there and on it a bird&rsquo;s nest containing half a
dozen speckled eggs.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a little luck, anyway,&rdquo; he murmured, and
taking some of the tree limbs, he made a fire and
cooked the eggs in the hot ashes. When they were
done, he broke off the shells and ate the eggs, and
although the flavor was by no means to be prized,
yet they did much toward relieving the hunger he
had felt before taking the fall over the cliff.</p>
<p>The day that followed was one which Larry says
he will never forget, and for good reason. Neither
human being nor beast came near him, and even the
birds flying overhead seemed to give him a wide
berth. Time and again he cried out, but the only
answer that came back was the echo from the cliff,
repeating his own words as if in mockery. Occasionally
he heard firing at a great distance, but
toward nightfall even this died out. He could
scarcely move from his resting-place, and it was not
until darkness came on that the pain in his ankle
subsided sufficiently to allow of his sleeping in
comfort.</p>
<p>The long sleep did the boy a world of good, and
when he awakened he found the swelling in his
ankle gone down, along with much of the pain, and
on getting up he found that he could walk, but it
must be slowly and with care. He was again
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
hungry, and his first effort was to supply himself
with something to eat.</p>
<p>To bring down even a small animal was out of the
question, but he thought he might possibly knock
over a bird or two, and with this in view cut himself
several short, heavy sticks. The birds were coming
down to the pool to drink, and watching his chance
he let fly with the sticks and managed to bring
down two of the creatures, and these formed the
sum total of his breakfast, although he could have
eaten twice as many. There were a number of berries
to hand, but these he refrained from touching,
fearing they might be poisonous.</p>
<p>Larry felt he must now go on. To gain the top
of the cliff was out of the question, so he decided to
strike out directly for the southwest, feeling that
this must sooner or later bring him into the American
lines. To be sure, he had first to pass the Filipinos,
but this could not be helped, and he felt that
the best he could do would be to keep his eyes and
ears open and walk around any body of the enemy
that he might discover, instead of trying to steal his
way straight through. This would require many
miles of walking, and on the sore foot, too, but this
hardship would have to be endured.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span></div>
<p>Half a mile was covered in a slow and painful
fashion, when Larry reached a small clearing, and
here he sat down to rest on a fallen tree and to
examine the ankle, which he was afraid was again
swelling. He was engaged in looking at the
wounded member, when a rough Tagalog voice
broke upon his ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you here?&rdquo; demanded a heavy-set
native, in his own tongue, as he strode forward, gun
in hand, followed by several others.</p>
<p>Larry was startled and leaped up. In a twinkling
he found himself surrounded, and several
Mausers were levelled at his head.</p>
<p>To resist would have been the height of foolishness,
and Larry did not try. The Tagals asked him
a number of questions in their own tongue, but he
shook his head to show them that he did not understand.
On their part, not one could speak English,
so neither party could communicate with the other.</p>
<p>The natives, however, soon understood that he
was alone, and when he pointed to his ankle and
limped, also understood that he had sprained that
member. One went into the bushes, and presently
returned with some leaves, which he crushed and
packed inside of the boy&rsquo;s stocking. The juice of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span>
the leaves proved very cooling, and presently much
of the pain from the sprain went away.</p>
<p>The Tagals were bound for the cliff, but by a
route different from that which Larry had travelled.
As the boy was unarmed and could scarcely hobble
along, they did not take the trouble to bind him in
any way. He was made to march with half of the
crowd before him and the others behind; and thus
they proceeded until the cliff was reached, at a point
where the jungle hid a series of rough steps leading
to the top. Beyond the top of these steps was a
mountain trail, which by nightfall brought them to a
plateau where were encamped at least three hundred
Filipinos of all classes, the Tagals predominating.</p>
<p>A shout went up as Larry appeared, and he was
at once recognized as one of the prisoners who had
escaped from the caves, which were fully four miles
away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So they have caught you again?&rdquo; remarked an
under-officer, as he strode up with a sinister smile on
his swarthy countenance. &ldquo;You did not get very
far.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I had a bad fall and lamed my foot,&rdquo; replied
Larry, as cheerfully as he could. He was never one
to &ldquo;cry over spilt milk.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;A fall? Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fell over the high cliff just below here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you live to tell it? Impossible!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it is true. I fell into a large tree, and that
broke my fall. But I was badly scratched up, and
my ankle was sprained.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A rare fall truly, boy. It would have been
better, though, if you had been killed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you; I like that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say it because you are a prisoner who has
tried to escape from us. Do you know the fate of
all such?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At these words Larry could not help but shiver.
He knew what the officer up at the cave prison had
said,&mdash;that any prisoner trying to escape would
be shot at the first opportunity which presented
itself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely, you would not kill me for trying to
get away?&rdquo; he cried quickly.</p>
<p>The under-officer shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;It
is not for me to change our regulations of war,
boy. Your words prove that you knew beforehand
the risk you were running.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes&mdash;but&mdash; You would try to get away
too, if our soldiers caught you.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly&mdash;I understand you treat your prisoners
very badly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our prisoners are treated as well as yours.
And we would not kill a Filipino for having tried
to escape,&mdash;unless, of course, he was shot in the
attempt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is you who say that&mdash;I have heard vastly
different stories; how our men were starved and
shot down without mercy,&mdash;not one man, but hundreds
of them. I have it from friends in Manila
that your General Otis is a monster who would
rather kill than save at any time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your friends have told you that which is not
true!&rdquo; exclaimed Larry, warmly. &ldquo;If anything,
General Otis is too kind-hearted, especially with
those who have done their best to put the city in
a state of rebellion and those who have tried to
burn it to the ground. I suppose your friends had
a purpose in telling you what was not true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I take my friends&rsquo; words in preference to yours,
boy,&rdquo; was the angry answer. &ldquo;Who are you that
come to take our country away from us&mdash;the
country that we tried so hard to liberate from the
iron grasp of Spain? The land is ours, and no
Americans shall govern us. We will fight to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span>
last,&mdash;from the cities to the towns, and from the
towns to the villages, and then to the mountains,
from one island to another,&mdash;and you shall never
conquer us, no matter how large an army you send
from across the ocean. But, bah, I am talking to
a mere boy, when I might have better sense.&rdquo;
And turning on his heel the under-officer strode
away, out of humor with himself as well as with
Larry.</p>
<p>The youth felt utterly crushed, and sitting down
on a rock, with a heart as heavy as lead, he wondered
what was going to happen next. Would
they really shoot him? The thought was agony
itself.</p>
<p>There were no other prisoners in the camp, so
he was left for a long time alone, although several
soldiers kept their eyes upon him, that he might
not wander away. Soon supper was served, and
one of the Tagals brought him a bowl of rice and
meat. It must be confessed that he was now tremendously
hungry, and ate all of what was given
him, despite his down-heartedness.</p>
<p>The meal finished, the Filipinos were sitting
around their camp-fires, when a certain General
Drummo was announced. At once there was a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span>
parade, which the general reviewed with satisfaction.
The newcomer was served with supper, and
then Larry was brought before him.</p>
<p>The general had his head full of his plans for
the morrow and gave the boy but scant attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You knew the risk you ran when you stole
away,&rdquo; he said, in broken English. &ldquo;It is true you
are but a boy, yet I&rsquo;ll wager you can use a gun
better than some of our own men. I cannot pardon
you, for that would be setting a bad example.
So I hereby sentence you to be shot at sunrise
to-morrow,&mdash;and may your death be an example
to others who are thinking of escape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before Larry could say a word, if indeed he
wanted to speak, he was led away to a hollow back
of the camp. Here he was tied fast to a tree, and
two soldiers were detailed to guard him until the
hour for his execution should arrive.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX</h2>
<h3>A RESCUE UNDER DIFFICULTIES</h3>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing here, cap&rsquo;n.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Boxer the scout who spoke. For two
hours he, Ben, and Luke Striker had been examining
the trail running along the cliff. They could
find footprints without number, but no trace of
Larry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must have gone somewhere,&rdquo; replied Ben,
who could not bring himself to give up the hunt.
&ldquo;He wasn&rsquo;t spirited away. I&rsquo;ve a good mind to
make a hunt at the bottom of the cliff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you will, cap&rsquo;n. But, remember, this air
side o&rsquo; the valley is full of rebs, and if they catch
us&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must be on our guard, Boxer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got my eyes wide open,&rdquo; put in Luke.
&ldquo;I reckon on it as how I can see as far as any on
&rsquo;em, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The walk to the cliff had not been accomplished
without difficulty. Twice had they come close to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span>
running into the Filipino pickets, and once Luke
had been almost certain they were being followed,
but the alarm proved false. A night had been
spent in the jungle, and at a point within half a
mile of where Larry lay senseless under the big tree!</p>
<p>The hunt had revealed to the party the series
of rough steps mentioned in the last chapter, and
down these they now went and continued their
search at the base of the cliff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; came from the old sailor, presently,
and he pointed to the broken sapling hanging
in the branches of the big tree. With the
sapling was a shred of a garment, fluttering in
the breeze like a signal of distress.</p>
<p>A close examination caused them to reach a
conclusion which was, as we already know, true;
namely, that Larry had come down with the sapling
and landed in the big tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he wasn&rsquo;t killed, either,&rdquo; said Boxer.
&ldquo;For here is where he built a fire and cooked
some birds&rsquo; eggs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he visited the pool, too,&rdquo; added Ben,
examining the tracks with care. &ldquo;Funny tracks
these,&rdquo; he added, a second later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was hopping on one foot,&rdquo; announced the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span>
scout, gravely. &ldquo;That looks as if he had one leg
hurt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was an easy matter to follow the trail through
the jungle, for the ground was damp and covered
with a moss which was torn with ease. Soon they
reached the clearing where Larry had stopped to
examine his ankle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo, more footprints!&rdquo; ejaculated Boxer, his
face falling. &ldquo;And rebs, too, I&rsquo;ll wager a new hat.
Cap&rsquo;n, I&rsquo;m afraid your brother has run into worse
trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It certainly looks like it,&rdquo; answered Ben.
&ldquo;Where do the footprints lead to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Where but back to the very rocks down which
they had come but a few hours before! Soon they
were back at the top of the cliff again.</p>
<p>Before leaving the valley Boxer studied the footprints
closely, and now, although there were other
footprints above, he followed the party having
Larry in charge without making a single error.
But it was slow work, and the encampment of the
Filipinos was not discovered until nightfall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve tracked &rsquo;em to a finish,&rdquo; announced
Boxer. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go any further, cap&rsquo;n&mdash;unless
you are ready to do some tall shooting.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I can do some shooting if it&rsquo;s necessary,&rdquo;
answered Ben, with a determined look on his face
which was not to be mistaken. &ldquo;I should like to
make sure my brother is here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll walk around the camp and see,&rdquo; said
Boxer, and this they did, slowly and cautiously,
each with his weapons ready for immediate use.
But the Filipinos were busy eating their suppers
and smoking cigarettes, and did not discover them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s Larry!&rdquo; cried Luke, after a while.
And he pointed to one side of the camp. The
guards were just taking the lad to the general to
be sentenced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes!&rdquo; answered Ben. He handled his
pistol nervously. He could hardly restrain himself
from rushing forward and embracing the long
lost. Boxer saw what was in his mind and held
him back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be rash, cap&rsquo;n,&rdquo; whispered the scout.
&ldquo;If you are, it may cost all of us our lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will try to be careful,&rdquo; was the answer, with
an effort. &ldquo;But what are they going to do with
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are taking him over to yonder tent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Soon Larry disappeared inside the tent, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span>
they crouched behind the bushes to await developments.
While waiting, Ben made a mental calculation
of the number of the enemy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A battalion, or more,&rdquo; he said to Boxer. &ldquo;I
wonder what they are doing so far from the main
body of the troops?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, their army is becoming badly scattered,
cap&rsquo;n. General Lawton has &rsquo;em on the run, and
there won&rsquo;t be any of &rsquo;em left when he gets through
with &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As we know, the scene in the tent was a short
one, and soon they saw Larry come out again, and
saw him tied to the tree. The two soldiers
detailed to guard him sat on either side of their
prisoner, on rocks about six or eight yards from
the tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He seems to be the only prisoner in the camp,&rdquo;
whispered Ben. &ldquo;I wonder if I can&rsquo;t crawl up
and cut him loose. I did that once for Gilbert
Pennington.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; interposed Boxer. &ldquo;Those guards
are wide awake and will shoot you in a minute.
Wait till it gets darker&mdash;we may get a chance to
do something then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slowly the minutes drifted by, Ben watching
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span>
Larry every instant. He saw that his younger
brother was exceedingly tired and held one foot
up as if in pain. The young sailor had asked
if he might not lie down, but this comfort had
been denied him.</p>
<p>Both of the guards were puffing vigorously on
their cigarettes, when one chanced to throw down
a lighted match close to the rock upon which he
was sitting. It set fire to some dry grass, but
instead of putting it out, the guard watched the
tiny conflagration grow stronger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Playing with fire, eh?&rdquo; said his mate, lightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; was the slow answer. &ldquo;How I would
like to see Manila go up like that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I would like to see that, too, Carlos, and
the Americans in the flames. Ah, but the day
when we are to take the capital seems a long
way off now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind; Aguinaldo says he is soon to
have re&euml;nforcements from the south. When they
come, let the American dogs beware!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The talk was carried on in the Tagalog dialect,
so Larry understood not a word. In the
meantime, the fire crept up, making the guard&rsquo;s
seat anything but comfortable.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s too much,&rdquo; he observed, and was on
the point of kicking the fire out with his foot,
when of a sudden he uttered a wild yell that
startled everybody near him. &ldquo;A snake! a snake!
Oh, what a long creature!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For from under the rock a huge reptile had
glided, roused up by the heat. It was a snake
peculiar to those mountains, and all of ten feet
long and as thick as a man&rsquo;s arm. It struck the
guard in the knee, and then whipped around in
increased anger, for its tail had come in contact
with the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A snake!&rdquo; echoed the second guard, and fired
his Mauser at the reptile. But he was too excited
to shoot straight, and the bullet glanced
along the rock and struck the first guard in the
cheek, inflicting a fairly serious wound.</p>
<p>The cries of the two guards&rsquo; were taken up on
all sides of the camp, and especially in the vicinity
of the rock from under which the reptile had
appeared. All the soldiers recognized the snake
as a dangerous enemy; and as the reptile moved
about, first one and then another ran to get out
of its way, several in the meantime taking hasty
shots at it, but failing to do any serious damage.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span>
For several minutes the prisoner was entirely forgotten.</p>
<p>It was Ben who saw the opportunity,&mdash;Ben and
the ever-faithful Luke,&mdash;and rushing up, they cut
Larry&rsquo;s bonds and fairly hustled him into the
depth of the jungle behind the encampment. The
young sailor could hardly understand what was
taking place, but when he recognized his brother
and his old messmate, he gave a shout of joy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You, Ben! and Luke! Oh, I must be dreaming!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you are not dreaming, Larry. We&rsquo;ve
been watching you for a long while, trying to
do something. Can you run?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I sprained my ankle, and it is still sore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll carry him,&rdquo; said Luke. &ldquo;You lead the
way, cap&rsquo;n. And Boxer had better bring up the
rear guard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right you are,&rdquo; came from the scout. &ldquo;Have
your weapons ready, cap&rsquo;n. We may catch it hot,
in spite of the alarm over the snake. Those rebs
will be as mad as hornets when they find the
lad is missing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Away they went, Ben trying to find an easy
path,&mdash;which was no small thing to do in that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span>
utter darkness,&mdash;and Luke coming up behind,
breathing like a porpoise, but vowing he could
carry Larry a mile were it necessary. Boxer
kept as far to the rear as he dared without missing
their trail, and the life of any Filipino who
might have appeared would not have been worth
a moment&rsquo;s purchase at the scout&rsquo;s hands.</p>
<p>They had covered but a few hundred yards
when the shouting and firing at the encampment
ceased. &ldquo;I guess the snake is dead,&rdquo; said Ben.
&ldquo;Now they&rsquo;ll be after us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young captain was right; and soon they
heard the enemy breaking through the jungle in
detachments of three or four men each, all hot-footed
to recapture the prisoner. They had observed
the cut ropes and wondered if it was
possible that Larry had severed them without
assistance.</p>
<p>It was not long before Boxer got a good shot
at the nearest of the pursuers. His aim was true,
and the Tagal went down without so much as a
groan. His companions stopped short, and then
called some other soldiers to the scene. &ldquo;The boy
is armed and shoots like a sharpshooter,&rdquo; they told
each other; and after that the search was continued
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span>
with extra care. Of course Boxer kept
out of sight; and as soon as he could, he joined
Ben and the others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think there must be a stream close at hand,&mdash;the
one we crossed a few days ago,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;If
we can get to that, we&rsquo;ll have some chance to hide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get to it, then,&rdquo; gasped Luke, who felt
that he could keep up but a short while longer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take Larry, Luke,&rdquo; put in Ben, and the
transfer was made, in spite of the old sailor&rsquo;s
protests. Then Luke plunged ahead and soon
announced that he could see the river through
the bushes to the right. Soon they came out on
some rocks. The stream was a mountain torrent,
a rod wide and from two to three feet deep.
They plunged in without delay.</p>
<p>As they could not walk against such a current,
they followed the stream on its downward course
almost to the edge of the cliff, where the torrent
formed a pretty series of waterfalls. Then they
crossed to the other side, and climbed into a tree
growing directly at the water&rsquo;s edge,&mdash;a species
of willow, with long, drooping branches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ought to be safe here&mdash;at least for
a while,&rdquo; said Boxer.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to tell where one would be safe
here,&rdquo; answered Ben. &ldquo;The whole country seems to
be invested with scattered bands of the insurgents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He asked Larry about himself, and in a few
words the younger brother told his story. Then
Boxer stopped the talk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a situation like this, it&rsquo;s best to have only
ears and eyes,&rdquo; he said, and all saw at once the
aptness of the remark.</p>
<p>But though they remained on guard the larger
part of the night, nobody came to disturb them,
and the only sound that broke the stillness was
that of the water as it tumbled over the rocks below.</p>
<p>Ben was much worried over Larry&rsquo;s ankle, which
had begun to swell again through having stood
so long on it while being tied to the tree. He
brought a canteen of water up from the stream
and bathed it with this. This moistened the
mashed-up leaves once more, and then the injured
member felt better, and Larry caught a nap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon we had better be moving again,&rdquo;
said Boxer, while it wanted yet an hour to daylight.
&ldquo;Those rebs may be waiting for to see us,
you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my brother can&rsquo;t run, so perhaps it will be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span>
just as well if you take a scout around and see if the
coast is clear,&rdquo; said Ben.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, cap&rsquo;n.&rdquo; And Boxer made off without
delay, moving through the jungle and along the
stream as silently as some wild animal in search of
its prey.</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes and more passed, and they began
to wonder when the scout would come back, when a
low whistle reached their ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; came from Boxer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody in sight?&rdquo; questioned Ben.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nary a reb, cap&rsquo;n.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad of it,&rdquo; put in Larry, with a sigh of
relief. &ldquo;I never want to fall in with them again!&rdquo;
And he shuddered. He would never forget how
close he had been to death at their hands.</p>
<p>They came down the tree, and after a drink
from the stream, set out again, this time following
the watercourse over the rocks until the cliff was
left behind. Here they struck a bit of marsh and
had to make a detour, finally coming out, much to
their surprise, on what appeared to be a regular
highway through the forest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, if we only knew where this leads to,&rdquo;
cried Ben.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon it leads to San Isidro,&rdquo; came from Boxer.
&ldquo;But we may be a good number of mil&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look! look!&rdquo; ejaculated Striker, pointing up
the road. &ldquo;The rebels, as sure as you air born!
An&rsquo; they air comin&rsquo; about a thousand strong, too.
Boys, we air lost!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>
<h3>THE FALL OF SAN ISIDRO&mdash;CONCLUSION</h3>
</div>
<p>Luke Striker was right; a large force of Filipinos
were sweeping down the road at a rapid rate,
bringing with them two old field-pieces and a
rapid-firing gun. They were commanded by several
officers on horseback, and presented a formidable
appearance to the worn-out Americans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out of sight, quick!&rdquo; The cry came from Ben.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s our only chance to escape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words had scarcely left his lips when the
pop-pop of several Mausers was heard, as the Filipino
sharpshooters, who were in advance of the
main body, opened fire upon them. Their aim was
excellent, and both Striker and Boxer were hit,
although neither seriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve caught me!&rdquo; ejaculated the old sailor,
and staggered up against Ben. At the same time
Boxer pitched headlong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Luke!&rdquo; The call came from Larry, who
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span>
was limping painfully. &ldquo;Where did they hit you?
This is the worst of all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m struck in the shoulder. But come, Ben is
right. To the jungle!&rdquo; And Striker clutched
Larry&rsquo;s hand in a death-like grip, bound to live or
die with his closest friend, as the case might be.</p>
<p>The pair started forward. Ben hesitated and
looked at Boxer, and saw the latter try to stagger
up once more. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not dead,&rdquo; thought the young
captain, and picked the sharpshooter up. In a few
seconds more the whole party were in the jungle
again.</p>
<p>But the Filipinos were not going to let them escape
thus easily, and coming up on the double-quick,
a detachment began to search the bushes, at the
same time calling on the Americans to surrender
if they wanted to save their lives.</p>
<p>With Larry limping painfully, and both Luke
and Boxer groaning in spite of their efforts to keep
silent, the Americans looked about for some spot
which might prove a safe hiding-place. But the
ground here was level and the jungle rather spare,
and for those who were wounded to climb trees
was out of the question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to make a stand, I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span>
Ben, looking to his pistol to see if it was fully
loaded. &ldquo;They are coming&mdash; Hark!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young captain broke off short, as a loud
shouting from the road interrupted him. Then
came a volley of musketry, followed by a steady
stream of shots.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got them this time, boys!&rdquo; came in a
ringing, English-speaking voice. &ldquo;Forward, and
don&rsquo;t let a man of them escape. On to San
Isidro!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our troops!&rdquo; cried Larry. &ldquo;Oh, God be
praised that they are coming this way!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, our troops!&rdquo; ejaculated Ben. &ldquo;And
what is more, my regiment!&rdquo; The revulsion of
feeling was so great that he felt like dancing a
jig.</p>
<p>The shouting and firing now increased, until it
was almost upon them. Then followed a rush
into the woods, and the little party found itself
face to face with a score of Filipinos.</p>
<p>At first our friends were greatly alarmed, and
Ben and Larry did their best to defend themselves
by firing as rapidly as possible at the Tagals
as they appeared. But the enemy was retreating,
and gave the little party scant attention. Then
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span>
came a yell close at hand, and in a few seconds
a squad of American soldiers burst through the
thicket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dan Casey!&rdquo; cried Ben, as he recognized the
Irish volunteer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, an&rsquo; is it Captain Russell?&rdquo; came from
the soldier, joyfully. &ldquo;It is, the saints be praised!
We&rsquo;ve been a-wonderin&rsquo; what had become of yez!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Town mit dem Filibinos!&rdquo; The call came
from Carl Stummer, and soon he also put in an
appearance. &ldquo;Dis vos von lucky tay,&rdquo; he said,
when he saw the party. &ldquo;Ve haf dem repels on
der run like neffer vos.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then send them a-flying, Stummer,&rdquo; answered
Ben. &ldquo;Where is our camp?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pack dere apout half a mile. Ve vos move
up las&rsquo; night und steal von march on dem Filibinos.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no time to say more, excepting to
stop several of the soldiers, and assisted by these,
the whole party moved to the rear, through line
after line of American troops now hurrying to the
firing line, for it was General Lawton&rsquo;s plan to
give the Filipinos no rest until San Isidro and
the territory in its vicinity were captured.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span></div>
<p>Inside of half an hour, Ben had seen to it that
Larry, Luke, and Boxer were all made comfortable,
and then, hastily swallowing a bowl of coffee and
some bread and meat, he hurried after his command,
which was threshing the jungle just outside
of San Isidro for scattered bands of the enemy
such as the young captain and his party had met.
Soon Ben was on the firing line once more, and
warmly greeted by Major Morris, Gilmore, and his
other friends.</p>
<p>The fighting was hot, for the rebels felt that if
San Isidro was taken, nothing would remain to
them but the mountains. They had constructed a
high embankment just outside of their capital, and
this they were defending vigorously, many of their
leading generals being at the front to direct the
movements.</p>
<p>But General Lawton was now in his element,
and feeling that his troops would do whatever he
asked of them, he began to spread out to the
right and the left, thus enfilading the trenches
behind the embankment, which presently became
so uncomfortable that the rebels had to leave them.
At the same time a centre column continued the
attack from the front&mdash;a centre column composed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span>
principally of Minnesota troops and the regiment
to which Ben belonged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are leaving the trenches!&rdquo; exclaimed
Major Morris, who was watching the progress of
the battle through a field-glass. &ldquo;Forward, boys!
They are on the run again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A rattle of rifle-shots followed, and the battalion
carried the middle of the embankment with a
wild rush, planting Old Glory on the very top a
minute later. Then the regiment pushed on for
San Isidro proper. A hot skirmish was had on
the main street of the town; but the Filipinos had
had enough of it, and by nightfall were making
for the mountains as rapidly as their demoralized
condition would permit.</p>
<p>Se&ntilde;or Romano had told Ben where Benedicto
Lupez and his brother Jos&eacute; had been stopping in
San Isidro, and as soon as the young captain
could get the opportunity he hurried around to
the place, which was a large private boarding-house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a man here by the name of Lupez, I
believe,&rdquo; he said, as he presented himself, followed
by a detachment of half a dozen of his men.</p>
<p>The boarding-house keeper, who had just hung
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_311' name='page_311'></a>311</span>
out a white flag, eyed him suspiciously. &ldquo;How
do you know that Se&ntilde;or Lupez is here?&rdquo; he
questioned slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it, and I want to see him at once,&rdquo;
returned Ben, sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is&mdash;is not here&mdash;he&mdash;he went away this
morning,&rdquo; came with much hesitation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ye believe him, captain,&rdquo; put in Dan
Casey, who was in the detachment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will search the house,&rdquo; said Ben, quietly.</p>
<p>The keeper of the boarding-place protested, but
his protest was of no avail. The house was
searched from top to bottom, and in a back wing
they found Benedicto Lupez in bed, suffering from
a badly injured leg, the result of trying to ride a
half-broken horse which the insurgents had captured
from the Americans. He greeted the visitors
with a villanous scowl.</p>
<p>At first he tried to deny his identity, but the
Americans had been furnished with his photograph,
and a wart on his forehead proved a clew that
was conclusive. At once his effects were searched,
and under his pillow was found a leather bag
containing fifty thousand dollars in gold and in
American bank bills.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_312' name='page_312'></a>312</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;This is the money you stole from Braxton
Bogg,&rdquo; said Ben, severely. &ldquo;You need not deny
it. Where is the rest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At first Benedicto Lupez refused to talk, but
with a long term in an American prison in Manila
staring him in the face, he confessed that just
previous to the fall of San Isidro, he had divided
what was left of the money with his brother
Jos&eacute;, who had now left for parts unknown. This
confession was afterward proved to be true, and,
later on, Ben learned that with five thousand dollars
of the stolen funds Jos&eacute; Lupez had purchased
himself a general&rsquo;s commission in the insurgent
army.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I suppose we are lucky to get back the
fifty thousand dollars,&rdquo; said Ben, when he was
telling Larry of how he had found Benedicto
Lupez. &ldquo;A half-loaf is far better than no bread
at all, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered the young sailor. &ldquo;And who
knows but that we may run across this Jos&eacute;
Lupez some day, and get the balance? Anyway,
the recovery of that fifty thousand dollars means
at least eight or ten thousand dollars in our
pockets, as well as something for Uncle Job. I&rsquo;ll
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_313' name='page_313'></a>313</span>
wager uncle and Walter will be mighty glad to
get the good news we have to send them.&rdquo; And
then he added enthusiastically, which was just
like Larry, &ldquo;Hurrah, Ben, score one more victory
for Young America and Old Glory!&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Here we must bring to a close the adventures
of Ben and Larry Russell previous to and during
&ldquo;The Campaign of the Jungle&rdquo; under gallant General
Lawton. The campaign had lasted three weeks,
and during that time the troops had covered about
a hundred and fifty miles of territory, fought
twenty-two battles, captured twenty-eight towns,
and destroyed large quantities of army stores, including
three hundred thousand bushels of rice.
The losses to the Americans had been about fifty
killed and wounded, while the losses to the Filipinos
were nearly ten times as great!</p>
<p>With the fall of San Isidro, General Aguinaldo
and his followers retreated to the mountains, twelve
miles to the north of that town. At the same
time the rebels who had been opposing General
MacArthur&rsquo;s advance fell back to Tarlac, thirty
miles beyond San Fernando. But the Americans
had not sufficient troops at hand with which to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_314' name='page_314'></a>314</span>
garrison the many towns they had taken, and so
it was not long before some of the rebels came
back to one place and another, to take what they
could get, and to harass those natives who had been
friendly to our soldiers. In the meantime the
rainy season put a stop to further activity on a
large scale, and while the Filipinos sued again for
peace (but upon their own terms), General Otis
sent for additional troops, so that the next dry
season might see the rebellion brought to such a
finish that its resurrection would be an impossibility.
Many Americans pitied the sad condition of
the Tagalogs, but all felt that as matters were
now situated the supremacy of the United States
throughout the Philippines must be maintained.
Once the insurgents submitted to American authority,
we would do the very best we could by
them.</p>
<p>Shortly after the fall of San Isidro, General Lawton&rsquo;s
command marched to join that of General
MacArthur. In the meantime Larry and his
wounded friends were removed to the hospital at
Manila, whither Gilbert Pennington had already
been taken, along with many others. Here the
sick were given every attention, and soon the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_315' name='page_315'></a>315</span>
majority of our friends were on a speedy road to
health.</p>
<p>Ben felt that there was no need to write to
Walter, as his brother would ere long be in the
Philippines, but he wrote to his Uncle Job, telling
about the capture of Benedicto Lupez, and adding
that the prisoner had been sent to join Braxton
Bogg, and that the recovered money was safe in
the United States bank at Manila, waiting to be
returned to Buffalo. He also told about Larry,
and added that since the <i>Olympia</i> had sailed away
without him, the young sailor was now going to
throw in his fortunes with the soldiers.</p>
<p>The letter brought great joy to Job Dowling,
and he immediately wrote back, stating how pleased
he was, and adding that he hoped Ben would catch
Jos&eacute; Lupez and recover what was still missing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is easier said than done,&rdquo; said Ben to
Larry, as the pair read the letter together. &ldquo;Still,
if this Jos&eacute; Lupez is now a general in the rebel
army, we may meet some day.&rdquo; Strange as it may
seem, that day was not far off, as will be related
in a sixth and concluding volume of this series,
in which we shall meet all the Russell boys, as well
as Gilbert, Luke, and many of our other friends
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_316' name='page_316'></a>316</span>
again, and see what each did toward carrying our
flag to a final and lasting victory in the Philippines.</p>
<p>But now let us leave Ben and Larry, and also
the others. All had done well and richly deserved
the rest that came to them. Many adventures were
still in store for them, but it is doubtful if any
were to be more thrilling than those encountered
during &ldquo;The Campaign of the Jungle.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Under Dewey at Manila&rsquo; is a thoroughly timely book, in perfect sympathy with
the patriotism of the day. Its title is conducive to its perusing, and its reading to
anticipation. For the volume is but the first of the Old Glory Series, and the imprint
is that of the famed firm of Lee and Shepard, whose name has been for so many
years linked with the publications of Oliver Optic. As a matter of fact, the story is
right in line with the productions of that gifted and most fascinating of authors, and
certainly there is every cause for congratulation that the stirring events of our recent
war are not to lose their value for instruction through that valuable school which the
late William T. Adams made so individually distinctive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Edward Stratemeyer, who is the author of the present work, has proved an extraordinarily
apt scholar, and had the book appeared anonymously there could hardly
have failed of a unanimous opinion that a miracle had enabled the writer of the
famous Army and Navy and other series to resume his pen for the volume in hand.
Mr. Stratemeyer has acquired in a wonderfully successful degree the knack of writing
an interesting educational story which will appeal to the young people, and the
plan of his trio of books as outlined cannot fail to prove both interesting and valuable.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Boston
Ideas.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;Stratemeyer&rsquo;s style suits the boys.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class='smcap'>John Terhune</span>, <i>Supt. of Public Instruction,
Bergen Co., New Jersey</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The Young Volunteer in Cuba,&rsquo; the second of the Old Glory Series, is better
than the first; perhaps it traverses more familiar ground. Ben Russell, the brother
of Larry, who was &lsquo;with Dewey,&rsquo; enlists with the volunteers and goes to Cuba,
where he shares in the abundance of adventure and has a chance to show his courage
and honesty and manliness, which win their reward. A good book for boys, giving
a good deal of information in a most attractive form.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Universalist Leader</i></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Edward Stratemeyer is in danger of becoming very popular among the
young people of the country.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Burlington</i> (Iowa) <i>Hawk-eye</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The Last Cruise of the Spitfire&rsquo; is of deep interest to the bounding heart of an
enthusiastic boy. The book leaves a good impression on a boy&rsquo;s mind, as it teaches
the triumph of noble deeds and true heroism.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Kansas City</i> (Mo.) <i>Times</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us mention in passing two admirable books for boys, &lsquo;Reuben Stone&rsquo;s Discovery&rsquo;
and &lsquo;Oliver Bright&rsquo;s Search,&rsquo; by Edward Stratemeyer, with whom we are
all acquainted. This last bit of his work is especially good, and the boy who gets
one of these volumes will become very popular among his fellows until the book is
worn threadbare.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>N. Y. Herald.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;A good sea-tale for boys is &lsquo;The Last Cruise of the Spitfire,&rsquo; by Edward Stratemeyer.
There is plenty of adventure in it, a shipwreck, a cruise on a raft, and other
stirring perils of the deep.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Detroit</i> (Mich.) <i>Journal</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a simple, plain, straightforward manner, Mr. Edward Stratemeyer endeavors
to show his boy readers what persistency, honesty, and willingness to work have
accomplished for his young hero, and his moral is evident. Mr. Stratemeyer is very
earnest and sincere in his portraiture of young character beginning to shape itself to
weather against the future. A book of this sort is calculated to interest boys, to feed
their ambition with hope, and to indicate how they must fortify themselves against
the wiles of vice.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Boston Herald.</i></p>
